        "title": "Install MATLAB on a remote server",
        "content": "Context\nIf you have a piece of MATLAB code that requires high compute power, it is recommended that you take a remote server from the\nMeghamala Service: IIT Kharagpur\nand run your MATLAB code on the remote server. The following are the steps to install MATLAB on a remote server in KGP\nSteps\nGetting License: Since MATLAB is a proprietary software, installing it requires a license. You need to mail  [\n[1]\n] asking for the MATLAB license. You will receive  2 files named  -\nFIK.txt\nand\nnetwork.lic\nCopy those two files on the remote server using\nscp command\n.Copy the files preferably in the home directory.\nSSH into the server.\nDownload the Linux ISO image of MATLAB on the server using\nwget\ncommand. For example if you want to install MATLAB 2021B version, run the following command on the server.\nwget\nhttp://swrepo.iitkgp.ac.in/Matlab2021B/Linux/R2021b_Linux.iso\n5. Mount the ISO image on a directory(make sure that directory has enough space, at least 50 GB) using the following command. Here we are mounting  in a new directory called\nmathworks\ncreated in the the directory\n/media\nsudo mount -o loop\nR2021b_Linux.iso\n/media/mathworks\n6. In the\n/media/matworks\ndirectory, you will find many files. Among them, you will find the file called\ninstaller_input.txt\n7. Copy the contents of the file -\ninstaller_input.txt\nand paste them in a new file with preferably same name in a different directory(for example in\nhome\n). This installer_input.txt contains the MATLAB installation options, which need to be edited. The file is copied to a different location(like here\nhome\n) and edited there because one can't edit the installer_input.txt file in the mounted location -\n/media/mathworks\n8. Open the installer_input.txt present in home directory and edit the following lines\nYou can edit the options according to your usage. Here we assume that the machine username is ubuntu. Create a directory named matlab in home directory. We will be installing matlab in this directory. Hence path to this directory is the destinationFolder\ndestinationFolder=/home/ubuntu/matlab\nCopy the text in the\nFIK.txt\nfile,(file copied on the server in the second step) which is the format of xxxxx-xxxxx... and paste the key\nfileInstallationKey=12345-24564-.....\nagreeToLicense=yes\nLog files to check if installation is successful or not\noutputFile=/tmp/mathworks_ubuntu.log\nPath to\nnetwork.lic\nfile, which was copied on to the server using scp in the second step\nlicensePath=/home/ubuntu/network.lic\n9. Now to install matlab as per the above options, move to the directory\n/media/mathworks\n, where MATLAB iso image was mounted. To install run the following command\nsudo ./install -inputFile /home/ubuntu/installer_input.txt\nThe process will take some time. You can check the status of download at the file -\n/tmp/mathworks_ubuntu.log\n(Mar 16, 2022 18:16:44) Exiting with status 0\n(Mar 16, 2022 18:16:44) End - Successful\n10. To run matlab as a executable, add an alias in the\n~/.bashrc\nfile\nalias mat=/home/ubuntu/matlab/matlab/bin/matlab\nReload the session using the command -\nsource ~/.bashrc\n11. To check if matlab is installed or not, try running the command\nmatlab -help\nTroubleshooting\nSometimes the installation process fails because the directory might not have enough space. Please recheck the issue. From time to time monitor the log file.\nIn case of permission issues, try running the same command using\nsudo\nUsage\nTo run a MATLAB code on a long time, it would be a good idea to run the script in the background using a tool called\ntmux\n.\nFollow the steps.\nMove to the directory where your code is present\nOpen a new tmux session, using the command\ntmux new\nOpen MATLAB without desktop using the command -\nmatlab -nodesktop\nYou get access to MATLAB's command window\nRun the script you wish to run\nSave the workspace variables in a .mat file by runnning the following command in MATLAB command window -\nsave('script_vars.mat')\nscp\nthe\n.mat\nfile to your machine\nLoad the\n.mat\nfile on MATLAB, installed on your personal machine using -\nload('script_vars.mat')\nYou can now write code to analyse the data in\n.mat\nfile\nContact\nIf you face any issues while following the above instructions, feel free to contact Raghavendra Kaushik(\n[email protected]\n)\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Install_MATLAB_on_a_remote_server&oldid=169839\n\""

        "title": "How to prepare for FRM",
        "content": "(This guide is written by Ritesh Saraogi (HS '17))\nThe Financial Risk Manager (FRM) designation is an international professional certification offered by the Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP). The candidate is required to complete two levels of practice-oriented exam which covers major topics in finance & risk management and demonstrate two-years' professional work experience in the same field in order to achieve the FRM designation.\nFRM Part I\nExamination Pattern\nFRM Part I is a four-hour long exam held 3 times a year. The paper consists of 100 multiple choice questions focusing on tools used to assess financial risk: quantitative analysis, fundamental risk management concepts, financial markets and products, and valuation and risk models.\nPreparation Material\n'Schweser Notes for FRM Exam' provides sufficient material to clear FRM exam in a compact way. But, the level of sample questions in Schweser is a little below than that of actual FRM examination. So, after going through the book, one must solve sample practice papers for FRM available on GARP website. Many other sample papers are also available online for FRM preparation on websites like\nBionic turtle\nand\nEdupristine\n.\nIt is recommended to start studying 3-4 months before exam especially if you don't have previous knowledge of basic finance & quantitative analysis. One may excel with one month of study if he/she has a basic understanding of financial markets and has taken courses like Regression/Time series in college. Last 10-15 days should be devoted to practice the sample papers as there are high chances of minor mistakes given the mathematical nature of questions.\nPassing Marks\nThere are no fixed passing marks for FRM exam. Passing scores are decided by FRM committee and is generally based on relative performance.\nAlthough FRM does not declare marks of the candidate, it declares quartile for each of the four topics. It is generally recommended to be in top two quartile (i.e. above 50 %tile) in each subject. Else, scoring 3rd quartile (i.e. 25-50 %tile) in one subject should be compensated by a 1st quartile (i.e. 75 %tile above) in other. One must note that this is not the actual criteria, but a guess based on historical results.\nIn terms of no. of questions, one should correctly to solve 70+ questions for smoothly passing FRM exam. However, students solving around 60 question (correctly) passes the exam in general. Always remember that FRM does not penalize wrong answers. So, it is recommended to make a guess and attempt all questions in the paper.\nTopic-wise Guide\nFRM Level I contains four topics with following weightage:\nFundamental Risk Management Concepts (20% weightage)\nThe topic verifies the candidate's understanding of the basic concepts risk management, recent financial disaster and US credit crisis (2007-08), standard models in finance (like CAPM, Arbitrage pricing etc.) and GARP's Code of conduct.\nQuantitative Analysis (20% weightage)\nThis  topic is entirely mathematical covering the concepts of probability, regression and time series analysis. It should be easy to cover if you have done such courses during college.\nFinancial Markets & Products (30% weightage)\nThis topic deals with the mechanics of derivative products (options, futures, swaps etc.) and markets. This book requires good understanding & should take majority of your preparation time. It is recommended to read Options, Futures and Other Derivatives (\na book by John Hull\n) for a deep understanding of the chapters of this topic.\nValuation & Risk Models (30% weightage)\nThis topic introduces the aspirant to the use of various risk models and valuation techniques used for pricing of options.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_prepare_for_FRM&oldid=238535\n\""

Only the syntactical part will change.\nIf you haven't, it is high time that you learn C programming in your vacations (Winter and Summer).

        "content": "In the year 1952, under the leadership of Professor E. Braner, a group of ten students formed the nucleus of this department. Soon it developed into a full-fledged undergraduate programme. In 1956, it started offering post-graduate courses for the first time in the country. The Institute of Town Planners also had its beginning in this department. With time, pioneering attempts were made to start advance training in Building Science, Application of Computer Techniques in Architectural design Simulation, Presentation Graphics and Construction Technology. The consultancy activities of the department from government and large corporate clients in the country range from design of large townships, institutions, landscaped environmental planning to conservation of heritage sites and buildings. Some of the key areas of research include Building Technology and Management, Housing and Community Planning, Heritage Studies and Conservation, Urban Design, Visual and Graphic Design, Computer Applications in Architecture and Planning, GIS and Multimedia Applications, Environmental Design, Transportation Planning and Traffic Engineering, Metropolitan Planning, Infrastructure Planning and Systems Management.\nThe Department of Architecture and Regional Planning at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur has been a pioneer in architectural education in the country since its inception in 1952, and today, it continues to play a significant role in the emerging concerns and planned development of the built environment of the country.\nInception and Evolution of Department\nAfter Independence, India braved the challenges of modernity and development, with a vision to emerge as a techno-economic powerhouse.\nAccordingly, in 1951, the first Indian Institute of Technology ' was established in Hijli, Kharagpur. The Department of Architecture was conceived for ensuring a holistic integration of the development of science and technology with the normative and cultural dimensions at human society. The first of its kind in the IIT system, the department started its iourney in 1952 with the undergraduate course in architecture in l959, the first post-graduate course in planning was introduced by the Department, and the first doctoral degree was awarded in 1970.\nThe Damodar Valley Regional Plan and plans for the 'Steel Cities' of Durgapur and Bhilai were pioneering works of the Department. The conception and formation of National Association of Students of Architecture (NASA) in l955, the Regional Science Association in 1967, the National Organization at Students at Planning (NOSPLAN) in l976, and the West Bengal Chapter of the Institute of Town Planners, India (lTPI) in 1982 mark some of the other significant contributions of the Department towards furthering education and professional practice.\nToday, we are strongly networked with our ex-students, established all over the world. Their excellent performance has made us proud. Our alumni are an immense source of inspiration, and their continual contribution to their alma mater, both in terms of experience and funding, makes us grow.\nPrograms\nThe Department of Architecture & Regional Planning presently offers a five years graduayion programme in architecture (B. Arch.) and a two years post-graduation programme in city planning (M.C.P.). A doctoral research programme awards Ph.D. degrees in architecture, urban & regional panning and allied fields. ln addition, a joint M.C.P.-Ph.D. programme is also offered.\nBachelor of Architecture\nProgramme: B.Arch.(H) in Architecture and Regional Planning\nDuration: 5 years.\nAdmission to the five year undergraduate course in architecture is based on the merit list of the annual IIT Joint Entrance Examination (IIIJEE) and on Aptitude Test in architecture and design, The current intake is limited to thirty-two seats, with reservations for OBC/SC/ST candidates and persons with disability (PD) as per Government of India rules. More information on JEE.\nAn architect is a professional who designs buildings and built environments, and acts as the lead coordian for the entire construction of a proiect, from conception to completion. In architecture education, one is encouraged to develop one's creative talents and artistic skills, as well as hone one's analytical aptitude for building science and technological innovation.\nPROGRAMME BRIEF\nA studio-based design programme is complemented with a spectrum of theoretical studies including design principles, graphics, aesthetics and style, culture and history, ergonomics, building materials, methods of construction, structural principles, building utilities and services, climatology, energy and environment, project management, professional practices et cetera. Parallel the major in architecture, students can opt for minors from other departments.\nThe IIT academic calendar adopts a two semester system (Spring / Autumn) with about sixteen weeks in each semester, and forty hours of contact each week. The course also involves annual two-week study tours. The students are required to undergo professional training at select national and international organisations tor one semester. The final requirement for receiving the degree is a dissertation thesis and project.\nMaster of City Planning\nProgramme: Master of City Planning\nDuration: 2 years.\nGraduates of Architecture, Planning and Engineering (Civil) are admitted to the postgraduate course in city planning, according to the merit-list of the annual Graduate Aptitude Test for Engineers (GATE). Social scientists (economists, geographers and sociologists) qualifying in the National Aptitude Test (NET) are also eligible for admission. Sponsored students, Quality Improvement Programme (QIP) scholars and self-financing candidates with a good academic record and a minimum of two years of relevant experience are admitted, based on a test and interview. Seats are reserved for OBC/SC/ST candidates and persons with disability (PD) as per Government of India rules.More information onGATE,NET.\nThe main task of the urban planner is to guide the growth and development of urban areas, foreseeing possibilities and threats, and to coordinate public and private actions towards achieving a common desired goal of sustained development of the community. In planning education, the student is trained to confront the challenges in dealing with the complex set at issues of human settlements: its manifestations on space, society, economy, infrastructure and ecology.\nPROGRAMME BRIEF\nTheoretical studies are coupled with studio programmes directed towards an action learning process involving field surveys data analysis, mutual discussion, written reports and verbal presentations. The IIT academic calendar adopts a two semester system (Spring/Autumn) with about sixteen weeks in each semester, and forty hours of contact each week. ln addition, students visit a selected urban area and propose a draft Development Plan, as a group exercise. The students are required to undergo professional training at select national and international organisations for one semester. The final requirement for receiving the degree is a dissertation thesis and project.\nJoint M.C.P. - PH.D.\nProgramme: M.C.P.-Ph.D. dual degree.\nDuration: As per required\nEligibility criteria for the dual degree course are same as for the M.C.P. programme. However, at the end of first two semesters, interested students having CGPA 8.0 and above are eligible to appear for written test and/or interview intended to judge their suitability to enroll for doctoral research. Those who do not qualify for research can continue with their two-year post-graduate programme. Students selected for doctoral research are required to complete the two years academic curriculum of the M C.P. programme before enrolment for Ph.D. For these students, the M.C.P. and PhD. degree shall be awarded together, upon successful completion of the research programme, requirements of which are same as that of regular doctoral research.More information on GATE\nPH.D. (Arch & Regional Planning) / Doctoral Research\nProgramme: Research oriented\nDuration: As per required\nSelection for admission to the research programme is through a written test and interview of candidates having good overall academic record at the post-graduate level. Students with undergraduate degree in architecture or engineering may also apply, provided they have excellent academic records. Applications for admission are invited twice a year. All candidates are requned to have cleared GATE/ NET (however candidates with excellent academic records from reputed universities/ organisations may be exempted from this). Accepted candidates are awarded an Institute Fellowship. Scholars are also enrolled under the Quality Improvement Programme (Q.I.P.) of the Ministry at Human Resources Development, Government of India, and from the ongoing Consultancy Projects of the Department. However, such scholars are not eligible for Fellowships.

The photos would be geo-tagged. That means the publisher of a photo\nalso mentions the location where the photo has been taken and the\ntopic of that photo (like flower, market, nature etc.). There can be\na fixed set of topics. During the photo upload, EthPhoto will ask for the topic, and the user needs to enter it.\n2. The front-end of the application is a map (you may use OpenStreet Map), on which every users can see the photos that have been uploaded to EthPhoto. If I go to a specific location, I should be able to see all the photos tagged with that location.\n3. Apart from the location based photo tagging, a user can also browse the photo based on topics.

It provides emergency services inside the campus and an ambulance is sent immediately after a call.\nHistory\nFacilities\nControversies\nOn March 21, 2009, an erstwhile 3rd year undergraduate student Rohit Kumar went to the hospital for checkup. It was a Saturday evening and he was complaining of headache. Although there's no record of any report. Next morning, he had to re-visit the hospital because his conditions had gone worse and he was in severe pain. He was then sent back home with some prescribed painkillers. Unfortunately, while going back to his hostel he collapsed and his head hit a cow-trap. He was immediately taken back to the hospital where he waited around 3 hours to get an appointment with a doctor. After his arrival, the doctor without any treatment, referred him to Apollo Hospital, Kolkata stating that he needed a neurologist. He was put in an ambulance with two of his friends and one pharmacist and no trained paramedic. On the way, the conditions got worse and they decided to go for Midnapore Hospital instead. He was declared 'Dead on Arrival' at Medinipur Hospital.\nThis incident lead to an outraged protest against the Director, IIT Kharagpur. Thousands of people silently protested in front of his bungalow. Seeing the director not taking any action in the regard of improvement of facilities in the hospital, outraged students demanded Director's resignation. In consequence, Prof\nDamodar Acharya\nthe erstwhile Director resigned along with the Dean of Students' Affairs. Prof.\nMadhusudan Chakraborty\n, the then Deputy Director\n[\n1\n]\nwas criticized for making a comment about the incident, saying \"What's the big deal...\".\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nKOLKATA: Classes at the Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur were suspended on Monday, a day after its director Damodar Acharya resigned following violent protests outside his house by students alleging medical negligence behind the death of a collegemate.\n“Dr. Acharya, who owned moral responsibility for the death, faxed his resignation to the Board of Governors on Sunday evening. The Dean, Students’ Affairs, also resigned,” IIT registrar D. Gunasekaran told The Hindu over telephone.\nM.

        "content": "MFTP\nis google group based notification service that subscribes the notices from Training and Placement noticeboard of IIT Kharagpur. The service aims to simplify the hassle of viewing notices and updates by removing the web-login hassles of ERP with email notifications. But personal deployments can be made on Heroku, from the code on\nGitHub\n.\nHistory\nMFTP was conceived by Vikrant Varma and Vivek Aithal in a fit of frustration with the T&P noticeboard interface in ERP, during their placement season in 2015. At this time, it was required to repeatedly reload the ERP interface to check for new notices, which led to them missing several important notices, and nearly missing an urgent notice about a change in interview timing.\nMFTP works by repeatedly logging into ERP using some user's credentials, downloading the last few hundred notices, diffing them with previously fetched notices, and constructing updates out of new or changed notices. Notice attachments are also diffed, and are attached directly to the emails sent out. Email updates are easily filtered by a user's mail client. The mail + attachment format also has the advantage of being easily searchable in most mail clients.\nThe first design involved users subscribing for email notifications directly on an MFTP web interface. However,\nPpsreejith\nproposed the idea of using a Google Group, which seemed far simpler, and this was used for the final implementation. The Google Group has the disadvantage that anyone, including people from outside KGP, can ask to join the group. A simple question requiring knowledge of KGP serves as a minor gateway for entry into the group, to discourage casual outsiders from joining.\nExternal links\nMFTP Google Group\nSource code on GitHub\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=MFTP&oldid=22255\n\""

It was inspired by and is the successor of\nMFQP\n.\nPaper Upload\nQuestion papers for End Semester Exams, Mid Semester Exams, Class Tests and Supplementary Exams can be uploaded by users to the website. The following steps are to be followed:\nGo to\nhttps://qp.metakgp.org/upload\nUpload your question paper PDFs (at most 10).\nFor each paper uploaded, IQPS will try to guess the details of the paper (Course Code, Semester, Exam Type, etc.). Click on the Edit (pencil) icon next to each paper, and check all the details, filling any missing data.\nOnce you ensure that all details are correct, click on \"Upload\". This adds the papers to IQPS. Once admins approve your paper, others can find them on IQPS and benefit from them!\nYear Guidelines:\nThe \"Year\" field is to be set to the year in which the exam was held. For example: An autumn semester exam for the session 2024-25 should have the year set to 2024, whereas a spring semester exam for the same session will have year 2025.\nAdmins\nNot to be confused with:\nCommunity Admin\nAn IQPS admin is someone who has access to the admin dashboard, which can be used to approve, edit or delete papers. The project maintainer must be an admin.\nFor onboarding new admins:\nA new admin (who is not a member of the GitHub organisation) can be added by updating the\nGH_ADMIN_USERNAMES\nenvironment variable, which is a comma separated list of usernames of GitHub accounts of the admins.\nA\nmember of the GitHub organisation\ncan be made an admin by inviting them to the \"IQPS Admins\" team on GitHub.\nA screenshot of the UI for editing and approving papers on the admin dashboard of IQPS.\nPaper Approval\nPapers uploaded by users move to an review stage, where admins need to approve the paper before it is searchable publicly. To approve papers:\nGo to the admin dashboard:\nhttps://qp.metakgp.org/admin\n(Only accessible to admins)\nList of unapproved papers are shown. To approve a paper, click on the Edit (pencil) icon next to the paper. A edit view for the paper opens.\nOn the left, there is a preview of the paper PDF. It can be expanded to take up the full screen by clicking on the Expand icon.\nIn the center, there are options to edit details of the paper, and its approval status (Approved/Unapproved).\nOn the right, there is a listing of \"Similar Papers\". A paper is similar to another paper if they share the same course code, year, semester and exam type. In the listing, similar papers which are approved are highlighted green.\nEnsure all the details of the paper are correctly filled. Choose \"Approved\" for the approve status, and click on \"Update Details\" to approve the paper.\n'Note' field\nIn the edit options, a 'note' field exists which can be used to indicate additional information about the paper. Papers for Supplementary exams should have the note field set to \"Supplementary\". Other uses of the field include mentioning tests having conducted in multiple slots, or different papers conducted for different groups (e.g. different papers for first year and second year).\nSimilar Papers\nWhen approving a newly uploaded paper, the listing of similar papers shows other existing PDFs that are potentially for the same question paper. This is helpful in preventing accidentally having two PDFs for the same question paper. IQPS finds similar papers by looking for papers with the same Course Code, Year, Semester and Exam Type as the paper being edited. Similar papers which are approved will be highlighted in green, while unapproved papers will not be highlighted.\nBefore looking at the similar papers, ensure that the paper being approved has all the correct metadata, otherwise the similar papers listed may be irrelevant.\nNote that the papers shown under the listing aren't guaranteed to be the same paper as the one being edited, due to many reasons. Two papers being similar can mean any of the following: (In what follows, 'original paper' refers to the paper being edited / approved, and 'similar paper' refers to one of the papers listed under the listing)\nThe original paper and similar paper are for the same question paper.\nThe original paper is mislabelled (wrong metadata)\nThe similar paper is mislabelled (wrong metadata)\nThe original paper and the similar paper differ in the \"Note\" field (e.g. the similar paper is for a main exam whereas the original paper is for a supplementary exam, or vice versa). In this case no admin decision is required since everything is correctly labelled and no duplicate paper exists.\nThus, it is recommended to compare the contents of the PDFs of the original and similar paper(s) to identify the reason.\nManaging duplicated papers\nIn case the similar paper is for the same question paper (Case 1), the admin has to choose which version to keep. Here are some general guidelines to determine which version to choose in case multiple PDFs exist.\nAll questions and relevant information must be legible. The scan of the PDF must be of good quality.\nGenerally, scanned PDFs from the\nlibrary question paper archive\nare of higher quality (and thus preferred) than those uploaded by users, but this is not always the case.\nA PDF containing both questions and answers/solutions for the paper is preferred over one having only questions (since it is more helpful for the user).\nAn original typeset PDF of the question paper is preferred over a scanned PDF of the paper.\nIn other cases where some paper is mislabelled, the admin must fix the metadata for that paper.\nReplacing papers\nEach similar paper listed on the right has a checkbox next to them which can be used to replace papers with the one being approved. While approving a paper, check the boxes for all those papers which needs to be replaced. Then, approve the paper (click on \"Update Details\"). This will approve the paper, and delete the papers which were selected for replacement.\nArchitecture\nThe main web-app has a Rust backend and a React frontend. It uses a PostgreSQL database as its primary data store. The backend and the database is hosted on the\nserver\n. The frontend is hosted on Vercel.\nAnother service, called the 'crawler' is a Go script which crawls and downloads papers from the\nlibrary question papers archive\nfor a given year and semester, and spits out an archive with the PDFs and the metadata. Correspondingly, there is a Rust script 'import-papers', which can import the papers from the archive into the database.\nHistory\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=IQPS&oldid=239684\n\""
