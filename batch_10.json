        "title": "Department of Agricultural and Food Engineering",
        "content": "About the Department\nThe Agricultural and Food Engineering Department\nwas established in 1952, as the Agricultural Engineering Department on the recommendation of the Dhar Committee appointed by the Board of Governors, IIT Kharagpur in 1950. Subsequently on the upgradation of its academic programme, the department was renamed as the Agricultural and Food Engineering Department in 1994. Among the sixteen IITs, IIT Kharagpur has the sole distinction of having an Agricultural and Food Engineering Department.It conducts annual fest named Prakriti to create a platform for sharing ideas about agricultural developments from all over the country.\n[\n1\n]\nAchievements\n[\n2\n]\nTractor drawn combination tillage implements\nTractor drawn combination tillage implements are developed which can prepare the seed bed with less time, fuel and number of passes as compared to conventional tractor drawn tillage implements.\nEducational and design software\nThe department has developed a few window - based interactive software packages for use as teaching and research tools. These include Decision Support System for estimating Reference Crop Evapotranspiration (DSS_ET), Hydrologic Calculator to perform various hydrologic analyses and Soil Conservation Structure Designer to design various soil conservation structures. DSS_ET includes more than 20 ET estimation methods. It estimates ET and ranks applicable ET estimation methods based on data availability and climatic condition.\nImproved device for wet soil preparation\nThe traditional method of rice cultivation in wet soil requires 5-6 times ploughing by bullocks. The time and energy spent by man and animal has been found to be greatly reduced by the use of IIT Puddler. The machine can be pulled by a pair of bullocks and can cover 1 hectare area in a day.\nMechanized production of Indian milk sweets\nProducts like �Chhana', is the base material used for preparation of several Indian sweets like rasogolla and sandesh. A technology has been developed for continuous production of chhana by using helical tube heat exchangers and a whey separator. Sandesh, a delicious milk-sweet can be produced continuously by using a screw kneader and a vented single screw extruder. Untouched by human hand, the product attains greater shelf-life than those available in markets.\nTea cultivation in non-traditional area\nTea is conventionally cultivated in sloping lands and foothills. The department has developed technology to successfully cultivate tea in plain lands and wastelands by adopting appropriate land slope, drainage, plantation of shade trees and pressurized irrigation. With these management practices tea can be grown in lateritic plains and wastelands.\nImproved tractor seat\nA tractor seat having 18.9 N.mm-1 spring constant and 1.09 N.s.mm-1 damping coefficient has been found to reduce significantly the vibration and bring comfort to the operator. The seat has been field tested and recommended for Indian tractors.\nLow-cost polyhouse technology\nPolyhouse has been constructed for cultivation of off-season crops at controlled temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide inside the structure as per the requirement of the crops. The house can also be used to raise seedlings of vegetables and flowers. It is made of locally available bamboo and GI poles, mild steel flats and ultra-violet stabilized plastic films.\nAir-recirculatory tray dryer for fruits and vegetables\nIn an air-recirculatory dryer, a part of the exhaust air is recycled along with the ambient air. This gives higher thermal efficiency and produces dry products having low surface hardness and improved colour and flavor characteristics. The developed dryer can produce 2-3 kg dry products in about 6-7 hours. The technology has been transferred to SSP Ltd., Faridabad.\nRecycling of waste into compost\nWaste materials generated from agricultural, forest, aquatic, domestic and industrial sources are recycled and converted into compost. Different microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria and earthworms have been used as compost accelerators. The technology has already been transferred to Shewood Agrotech to commercially produce solid Vermicompost and liquid Vermiwash.\nBiodiesel production from non-edible oils\nA suitable process along with a processor has been developed to produce biodiesel from nonedible oils such as Jatropha, Karanja, Mahua, Simaruba with high free fatty acids. The processor comprised a reactor, chemical mixing tank and a settling funnel and it can handle 10 liters of oil per batch. The yield of biodiesel is around 98% and the fuel properties of biodiesel so produced are within the biodiesel standards prescribed by India, America and Europe.\nMicrobial enzymes in food\nVarious technologies are developed and transferred to use microbial enzymes for clarification of apple juice, debittering of pomegranate juice and polishing of germinated brown rice.\nResearch & Development Facilities\n[\n3\n]\nFarm Machinery & Power\nThe discipline has developed modern Tillage & Traction lab, Tractor testing lab, Ergonomics lab and Biofuel lab.

If specified in the Micro-Specialization curriculum, the subject can also be taken as Micro-Credit/s.\nA student has to register for a Micro-Specialization. The Registration can be done at the beginning of any Semester beyond the first year.\nIn order to register for a Micro-Specialization, the student must have completed all curricular requirements upto the previous semester and have a CGPA ≥ 7.0. Thereafter the student must maintain a CGPA or SGPA ≥ 7.5 without any Backlog in the subsequent semesters to keep the Micro-Specialization registration active.\nGPA for the subjects contributing to the Micro-Specialization will be separately calculated. A minimum GPA of 6.00 is essential to earn the Micro-Specialization.\nReferences\nUG Regulation Document\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Micro_Specialization&oldid=19096\n\""

Since, typing a large research work requires careful organization, referencing and presentation, the choice of word-processor or typesetting is an important consideration. The two common choices tend to be\nMicrosoft Word\nand\nLaTeX\n. While former provides excellent ease of usability and common formatting options, latter provides a granular control on content organization and generally produces superior quality documents.\nThe how-to discusses potential advantages of each method and illustrates how to do it.\nLaTeX\nAdvantages\nExcellent reference management\nWhitespace and layout is automatically typset (table of contents, index page, list of figures etc.) ensuring maximum readability\nEmbed high quality figure easily\nDisadvantages\nHas a learning curve; problem has be partially mitigated by using WYSIWYG editors\nRequires careful setup, errors can be hard to debug\nTemplate\nIt is best to start from a template. Fortunately, a few people have developed templates that you can adapt to write your own thesis. For example, Sarthak Jain wrote this\ntemplate\nspecifically for IIT Kharagpur's thesis styles. Download the file and read the instructions. However, note that each department has different guidelines regarding the format of thesis. The template can be adapted according to personal requirements.\nGeneral guidelines\nRemember, the top priority is to fulfill the thesis requirements of your department\nConsider the marginal utility of investing in thesis typesetting versus thesis development\nExternal links\nThesis writing - Pointers for keeping it simple and sleek by Sarthak Jain\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_typeset_your_thesis&oldid=239693\n\""

        "content": "[DEPRECATED] INSTITUTE NO LONGER USES PROXY.\nInternet connection inside IIT Kharagpur is provided through an HTTP\nProxy server\n. A proxy server acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from internet. For addresses that are on the KGP LAN Network, using the proxy server is not required.\nThe HTTP Proxy is\n172.16.2.30:8080\n(as of 6th July, 2017).\nThe proxy server can be bypassed for the address\n10.0.0.0/8\n. This\nCIDR\naddress will bypass the proxy for all addresses on the KGP network.\nSetup\nWindows\nIn Windows, most GUI programs will internally use Internet Explorer's proxy settings.\nThe default proxy settings can be updated by navigating to Internet Explorer's options.\nTools\n>\nInternet Options\n>\nConnections\n>\nLAN settings.\nThere are some programs however which don't use Internet Explorer's proxy settings. A prominent example of that remains the Windows Store in Windows 8 & 10. They can be set using\nnetsh\n, or network shell, a command-line utility which allows local or remote configuration of network devices such as the interface.\nThe following are some relevant commands (Run\ncmd as an adminisrator\nand type the following) :\n1.\nnetsh winhttp show proxy\n: This command shows the current proxy setting\n2.\nnetsh winhttp reset proxy\n: This command resets the current proxy setting to a direct connection.\n3.\nnetsh winhttp import proxy source=ie\n: This command sets Internet Explorer as the proxy source for\nnetsh\n, thus both sharing the same proxy.\nNote:\nFor some Windows users, the Git Bash accepts the proxy settings as mentioned below for Linux. In the Git Bash command line, input the following proxies:\nhttp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nhttps_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nftp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nLinux\nIn *nix based systems, proxy settings are controlled via environment variables which can be updated in a number of ways. A few of these methods are described below:\nSetting up proxy settings in Ubuntu's Network Manager.\nAutomatic Script\nIf you are on Debian/Ubuntu, use the script provided at the link to set system-wide proxies for mostly used commands instantly.\nhttps://github.com/thealphadollar/set_proxy_kgp\nIf you are on some other Linux distribution, please create an issue at the same repository.\nGUI\nIn most cases, a desktop environment (Unity for example; ships default with Ubuntu) provides a graphical user interface to access network settings under the\nSystem Settings\n>\nNetwork\noption. An option to set up proxies can be found there.\nYou can also use applications like dconf-editor to configure system wide proxy. You can also configure no_proxy settings using this application.\nCommand Line\nCommand line interface provides a quick way of updating your environment variables and thus your proxy settings. The proxy values are contained within the following variables -\nhttp_proxy\n,\nhttps_proxy\n,\nftp_proxy\n,\nsocks_proxy\n,\nno_proxy\n. One can update these values using a sample command shown below:\nexport http_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nThe variable\nno_proxy\ncontains those addresses for which the proxy access is disabled (useful for certain library websites, Moodle website, DC website etc.,). These settings, however, are not persistent through different login sessions and you must put these commands in your\n.bashrc\n(for\nbash\nshell) or\n.zshrc\n(for\nzsh\nshell) to be applied every time on shell startup.\nYou can also permanently export these settings to root environment settings by editing the\n/etc/environment\nfile. Open this file with\nsudo\npermission using your favorite text editor (\nvim\nfor example) and paste the following:\nhttp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nHTTP_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nhttps_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nHTTPS_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nFTP_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nftp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nno_proxy=127.0.0.0/8,::1,10.0.0.0/8\nSave and exit. The environment settings should now be always applied to your current environment. Verify this by checking the output of\nsudo env | grep proxy\n. It is, however, important to note that some applications might require their own proxy to be set up separately (\ngit\n, apt-get,\nwget\nfor example) and you must consult the appropriate man pages. To configure \"apt-get\" to use proxy add the following lines to \"/etc/apt/apt.conf\"\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nIn case you do not add the proxy options to root's environment, use the\n-E\nflag to ask\nsudo\nto preserve the existing environment variables. For example:\nsudo -E add-apt-repository \"deb\nhttp://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\nsaucy universe multiverse\"\nOS X\nGo to\nSystem Preferences\n>\nNetwork\n>\nSelect the appropriate service on the left (eg. WiFi)\n>\nAdvanced\n>\nProxies\n, and set both HTTP and HTTPS proxies.\nProxy bypass rules can be configured at the bottom.\niOS\nGo to\nSettings > Wi-Fi > Tap on the Wi-Fi network that you've connected to > Scroll down to HTTP Proxy > Set the server and port, and go back to the Wi-Fi screen for the settings to take effect.\nThere is no way to configure proxy bypass rules.\nRaspberry Pi\n1. For apt :\nNavigate to the following folder as follows:\ncd /etc/apt/apt.conf.d\nCreate a file called 10proxy:\nsudo nano 10proxy\nWithout authentication add these line:\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nWith Authentication add these line :\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"\nhttp://username:\n[email protected]\n:8080\n\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"\nhttp://username:\n[email protected]\n:8080\n\";\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy \"\nhttp://username:\n[email protected]\n:8080\n\";\n2. For everything else:\nEdit this file:\nsudo nano /etc/environment\nAdd these line :\nhttp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nHTTP_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nhttps_proxy=\nhttps://172.16.2.30:8080/\nHTTPS_PROXY=\nhttps://172.16.2.30:8080/\nFTP_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nftp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nno_proxy=127.0.0.0/8,::1,10.0.0.0/8\nAndroid\nSetting the HTTP proxy for WiFi on Android Lollipop.\nWhen connected to any of the mentioned access points, opening WiFi settings and long pressing the current WiFi network will give a\nModify Network\noption. Within this, scroll down and tick the\nProxy Server\ncheckbox and enter the IP address and port. This will allow you to use browser, play store and some other applications but\nWhatsApp\nand\nSkype\nwill not work.\nHowever, to use wifi for WhatsApp, Skype, messenger and other applications , you can use applications like Drony, Proxifier, Psiphon, DroidVPN etc. These apps are available in Play Store.\nAlso, it is to be noted that applications like Drony and Proxifier are proxy configuring app, they simply tunnel your whole internet traffic through a proxy server, in our case through IIT Kgp's proxy server whereas Psiphon and DroidVPN are VPN apps. The difference is that in former case , your internet requests are handled by IIT kgp's own server whereas in latter case an outside server handles your internet requests. Using internal server provides you privacy since your actual IP is \nAlso, speed wise Drony and Proxifier are better than Psiphon and DroidVPN. But the advantage of VPN apps over others is that you can access sites blocked by IIT Kgp like Torrents etc.\nIf the phone can be or is already rooted, applications like ProxyDroid and AutoProxy Lite may provide better experience. However, if you do not prefer to root your phone, use applications like DroidVPN, Psiphon or SurfEasy to configure proxy settings.\nWindows Phone\nGo to\nSettings > Wifi\nand touch on the required connection. It should give an option to setup the proxy.\nBypass\nThe proxy server does not route connections back inside the local subnet, but silently times out. To connect to a computer inside the KGP network, you need to bypass the proxy for that computer's IP, and make a direct connection. The following is a list of IPs and hostnames for which it is useful to bypass the proxy. An asterisk ( * ) or ( x ) represents any value.\nlocalhost and 127.0.0.1\nAll IPs in KGP's subnet – 10.x.x.x\n*.iitkgp.ernet.in\nIf you want to configure the\nno_proxy\nvariable, set it to\n10.0.0.0/8,127.0.0.0/8,::1\n.\nFor instructions on how to bypass the proxy for your OS or device, see\nSetup\n.\nWorkarounds\nKGP's proxies only allow HTTP connections on ports 80 and 443. This means that several much needed tools are broken behind the Great Fire Proxy. Depending on what you are trying to do, the following workarounds might be useful. These instructions are written with *nix based systems in mind, but equivalent alternatives for Windows can be found (often with same name).\nTor\ntor\nanonymises traffic, and has the useful side effect of convincing the proxy that we're making an HTTP connection.\nAs of September 2015, the institute is actively blocking tor connections, but bridge is not necessary to connect to tor.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\nBrowse the Internet through tor\nIf you only need to access websites through a browser, download the\nTor Browser Bundle\n, which provides a nice and easy to configure GUI setup and is available for Android, Linux, Mac, and Windows.\nSetting up tor in Android\nDownload Orbot from\nF-Droid\nor from\nPlay Store\nand install.\nGo to Settings > Select Outbound Proxy Type and enter HTTPS. Select Outbound Proxy Host and enter 172.16.2.30 Select Outbound Proxy Port and enter 8080.\nSelect 'Select Apps' option and tick those apps along with browsers whose traffic you want to route through tor.\nGo back to main screen and press Start. Swipe from right to left to see connection log. When connected, click on browse and choose a browser.\nTo stop tor press Stop and swipe from left to right and turn off 'Apps VPN Mode'\n(Optionally) download Orfox which is a tor browser for android and also if you want to surf onion websites.\nRun tor as a daemon\nSet up tor to run as a daemon on some port (eg. 9050). You can usually do this by installing tor using your distro's package manager (eg.\napt-get install tor\n).\nIn tor's config file (eg. /etc/tor/torrc), add\nHTTPSProxy <KGP proxy host>:<KGP proxy port>\n.\nTo make sure everything works, clear any existing HTTP or HTTPS proxy settings, and set your SOCKS proxy to use tor (eg. 127.0.0.1:9050). Go to\nhttps://check.torproject.org/\n, it should say that you're using tor.\nUsing tor to make the git protocol and OpenShift applications work (on Linux)\nDownload the\nTor Browser Bundle\nNavigate to the folder\n~/.ssh\nand edit the\nconfig\nfile. (You can create one if you don't have it already)\n$ cd ~/.ssh\n$ vim config\nAdd the following lines to the file to make the git protocol work:\n[\n3\n]\nHost github.com\n    User git\n    ProxyCommand connect -4 -S localhost:9050 $(tor-resolve %h localhost:9050) %p\nNow, run the following command after unzipping the downloaded archive of Tor:\n$ ./start-tor-browser.desktop\nNow, the git protocol should have started working.\nTo check this, you can run:\ngit clone\n[email protected]\n:metakgp/metakgp.git\nNote that for this to work properly, your SSH public key must be added to your GitHub account.\nIf it is not added [visit this guide on GitHub\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/\n]\nThis method can be used to get SSH access to OpenShift RedHat cloud applications as well, by appending to the config file:\nHost appname-domain.rhcloud.com\n    User rhcloud.com\n    ProxyCommand nc -x localhost:9150 %h %p\nReplace appname and domain in the above lines with the appropriate names from the OpenShift dashboard.\nTypically, an app that can be accessed at mentorship-gradescrapers.rhcloud.com has:\nURL: mentorship-gradescrapers.rhcloud.com\nappname: mentorship\ndomain: gradescrapers\nproxychains\nproxychains\ndoes TCP and DNS tunnelling through an HTTP server.\nSet up tor as outlined above.\nIn proxychains's config file (eg. ~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf), configure tor as a socks proxy (eg.\nsocks5 127.0.0.1 9050\n).\nNow, programs that make TCP connections on any port should work when run with proxychains. For example,\nproxychains git clone\ngit://example.com\n.\nProxyCap\nis a proxychains alternative for Windows and Mac.\nssh\nSee also:\nHow to SSH into a server that is outside the campus network\nOption 1 (recommended):\ncorkscrew\ntunnels ssh through an HTTP proxy. You need root access on the destination server for this to work.\nInstall corkscrew and in ~/.ssh/config, add the following line:\nProxyCommand <path to corkscrew> <proxy host> <proxy port> %h %p\n.\nOn the destination server, configure sshd to listen on port 443.\nPass in the\n-p 443\noption when running\nssh\n.\nOption 2: You can use proxychains + tor as outlined above. This will be slower, since the connection is routed through tor. However, it has the advantage of not needing to change the port sshd is listening on.\nssh-socks\nIf you have a remote machine that can listen on port 443 (as outline above), you can run a local socks proxy server on your machine to tunnel traffic through your remote machine. For example,\nssh -D 1080 -p 443 myserver.example.com\nwill start an SSH tunnel on port 1080, now you can use\n127.0.0.1:1080\nas a SOCKS proxy.\nOnline ssh clients\nOnline ssh clients are available to connect to remote server. An advantage of using this is that you do not need any extra softwares/configuration on your local computer or the server. Names of some of the websites are as follows :\nSerfish\n- A free AJAX SSH Client to quickly connect to remote server. (Registration not required)\nShiftedit\n- An online Web-based IDE with remote connection support. (Registration required)\nBanned websites\nOption 1: Use tor as outlined above.\nOption 2 (probably faster speeds): Set up a ssh-socks proxy.\ngit\nOption 1 (recommended): Check if there's an HTTPS version of the repo URL available, and use that if possible.\nOption 2: Use proxychains and tor as outlined above.\nOption 3: Use corkscrew for cloning, pushing, pulling using SSH instead of HTTPS (This avoids the requirement of having to enter username and password each time.)\nHost github.com\n   Hostname ssh.github.com\n   Port 443\n   ProxyCommand corkscrew 172.16.2.30 8080 %h %p\nOption 4: Override ssh settings to force use of port 443 instead of 22 for github.com. Ref:\n[1]\nHost\ngithub.com\nHostname\nssh.github.com\nPort\n443\nUser\ngit\nheroku\nOption 1 (recommended): Running commands on the command line of your heroku instance is not possible. Say you want to apply new migrations on a Ruby on Rails app, then, instead of running:\nheroku run rake db:migrate\nyou can run:\nheroku run:detached rake db:migrate\nThis will run the command (rake db:migrate, in this particular case) on the remote machine, and give another command which can be used to view the logs. The output of this command is similar to:\nRunning `rake db:migrate` detached... up, run.8799\nUse `heroku logs -p run.8799 -a app-name` to view the output.\nOption 2: Use proxychains and tor as outlined above.\nUDP\nHTTP Tunneling is a way of encapsulating UDP packets in HTTPS protocol. Currently the tor network does not support UDP. However, you can use VPNs to tunnel UDP traffic.\nInstall OpenVPN. For windows, there is a convenient GUI app.\nGo to OpenVPN settings and set HTTP proxy\n172.16.2.30:8080\n.\nGet .conf file for an openvpn server. vpngate.net has some free servers, be careful to download TCP conf., and only for servers open on port 443. Paid VPNs with stable connections are also available if you look for them.\nRun OpenVPN GUI as administrator (windows) and add KGP proxy. Load the .conf file you downloaded. This should create a new TUN/TAP device, and internet should now work without a proxy.\nThe connection will be flaky if using vpngate servers. Don't expect to be able to play online games this way, since tunneling would delay your UDP packets too much to get a good ping, even with stable VPN servers.\nsshuttle\nsshuttle\nis more easy and powerful over normal ssh socks tunneling for many reasons :-\nApp don't need to use a socks proxy\nClient don't need to have root access on remote machine\nYou don't want to create an ssh port forward for every single host/port on the remote network.\nIt's very simple to use. sshuttle requires\ncorkscrew\nfor tunneling. Steps :-\n$ git clone\nhttps://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle\nConfigure\ncorkscrew\ninside\n~/.ssh/config\n. A line in the file should be something like\nProxyCommand corkscrew 172.16.2.30 8080 %h 443\nStart sshuttle by navigating inside the cloned directory and running\n./sshuttle --dns -r username@sshserver 0.0.0.0/0 -vv\nRemove all the proxy settings whatsoever from browser, applications, `/etc/environment`, etc. i.e. use Direct Connection.\nsshuttle catches every tcp connection and routes it through the ssh server.\nnvm\nnvm\n(node version manager) is used to download, compile and install node.\nTo set proxy for nvm, use the following commands:\nexport http_proxy=172.16.2.30:8080\nexport https_proxy=172.16.2.30:8080\nexport NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=\nhttps://nodejs.org/dist\nnpm\nnpm\nis a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js\nTo set proxy for npm :-\nnpm config set proxy\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\nnpm config set https-proxy\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\nCloud Computing Services\nSeveral cloud computing services and VPS providers are now available for circumvention. Digital Ocean, Amazon EC2, Vultr, Google Compute Engine are some of the popular providers.\nStreisand\nis a convenient one-click solution to create an IPSec secured personal VPN based on the default L2TP/IP protocol. This protocol is supported by default on Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and several other operating systems.\nDigital Ocean\nis a cloud computing service, which provides SSH access to droplets in their data centers. Digital Ocean doesn't have a free plan, but credit of $50 can be obtained by signing up for the\nGitHub Student Developer Pack\n. (All currently enrolled students of the institute are eligible.) Further, Digital Ocean requires a Credit Card to be added as payment method (Credit/Debit card is only take as a payment method. You will not be charged anything on setting up the account, provided you are using student pack), or a $5 remittance\nthrough PayPal to get the account started.\nOnce the account can create droplets, droplets may be used for things such as SOCKS proxies, torrenting content through Command Line torrent clients (such as\ntorrent\n), or as an OpenVPN\nserver.\nHistory\nBefore the load balancer proxy was introduced, several proxies could be configured. These proxies had different speeds and availabilities at different times. Some of the older proxies were:\n144.16.192.247\n144.16.192.245\n144.16.192.217\n144.16.192.218\n10.3.100.209\n10.3.100.210\n10.3.100.211\n10.3.100.212\nIn 2014, students were instructed to use a single load balancer proxy.\n[\n4\n]\nThe other proxies no longer work.\nPublic IPs\nThe outside world sees one of the following IPs as your IP when you make any network request. This public IP is converted to an internal IP (which is what you see as your machine's IP) by the proxy server using\nNAT\n. You may need to whitelist these IPs if setting up an external web service that is frequently accessed from campus.\n203.110.246.22 (as of 11 August 2015)\n203.110.246.23 (as of 2 September 2015)\n203.110.243.23 (as of 12 August 2015)\n203.110.242.20 (as of 7 September 2017)\n203.110.242.7  (as of 25 April 2018)\nYou can see your current public IP at\nhttp://www.whatsmyip.org/\n.\nIt is important to know this because any activity done by you gets logged with these IPs and corresponds to the name of the institution. For example, if you make an anonymous edit to Wikipedia, it will be logged under these public IPs, and hence any disruptive behavior by single person might lead to an IP ban and unavailability of resources for everyone inside the campus. It's advisable to create an account for such activities wherever possible, or use one of the workarounds suggested in initial sections.\nSee Also\nInternet and LAN\nHow to SSH into a server that is outside the campus network\nHiT Hi FiT Hai\nDC\nExternal Links\nSet up apt-get to use a http-proxy\nnpm proxy setting\nTop free VPNs\nReferences\n↑\nVerified\nby\nCic\non September 9, 2015.\n↑\nVerified\nby\nrandomkgp\non October 15, 2017.\n↑\nVerified\nby\nIcyflame\non 2015-09-25.\n↑\n\"TSG Facebook post instructing students to use the load balancer proxy\"\n.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Institute_proxies&oldid=146458\n\""

Blooming with it come the innocent first years, unknowing and curious to explore the beautiful campus. Their wish is fulfilled by the Azad hall of residence by organizing KHOJ, a campus treasure hunt for inspiring the first years to explore the campus with friends as a game and make it one of the most memorable event of their stay in IIT KHARAGPUR. It was started in 2000. KHOJ is the first and the biggest event organized exclusively for the first years. Boys and girls of the campus equally participate in it with full zest and zeal. The students are required to form a group of five, and then the teams are given clues of a place in the campus. They are required to unlock the clues, reach the required place and then find the code hidden somewhere at that place. This is done many times until a team unlocks all the clues and is declared the winner and prizes rain in the event with many teams getting prizes just based on their luck! Though the winner of the event may be one team but the enthusiasm the first years show makes everyone a winner. The event brings with itself joyfulness in the entire campus and gives a first year opportunity to interact with his/her batchmates and the campus. The event continues to grow every year bearing a testimony of the saga of the AZAD HALL OF RESIDENCE.\nAlumni Contributions\n1)Mr. Supriyo Sircar(1987) - Basketball Ground\n2)Mr. Bhaskar Dutta (1970) - Music Room\n3)Mr. Subhendu Mandal (1995) - Football Ground\nAzad Hall Anthem\nAzad Hall of Residence is the only hall in IIT KGP to have a Hall Anthem and an Oath of Fire.

        "content": "Credit:\nVivek Rai\n, BT '17\nRecommendation letters are the most critical part of any graduate school application. Admission committee evaluate the applicants profile based on what the recommenders have written about the candidate and whether that corroborate the description given by the student in their statement of purpose. Typically, universities require 2-3 recommendations per application. Some may require specific people such as professors, thesis advisors to be a compulsory letter writer.\nIdeally, the letter is to be written entirely by the faculty in a confidential manner with the knowledge that it is going to be a good or great letter. However, many faculty will ask for a draft letter written. This guide will illustrate a few examples of such drafts which one may adapt for their own requirements.\nTraits of a good letter\nThis section requires\nexpansion\n.\nExample\nLetter for PhD (#1)\nJohn Doe\nProfessor, [department]\n[division]\nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur\n[email]\n\nNovember 15, 2016\n\nRe: To Whom It May Concern\n\nI am pleased to recommend [applicant] for his PhD program of interest at your institution. I am a Professor in the [department] at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, one of the leading engineering institutes in India. As an educator and mentor to [applicant], I have known him for the past 2 years. I can rate him as being amongst the top 2% of students that have passed through my laboratory for short periods of time, and amongst the top 5% of students that I have seen ready to pursue a PhD programme.\n\nI taught [applicant] in [course] class during his junior year, and he excelled in his performance securing highest grade (EX) among an extremely group of senior students. Later, he expressed interest to work in my lab for his undergraduate project on analysis of protein knots and is continuing to work on it as his final year thesis, learning about sequence analysis, functional annotation, and mathematical biology.\n\n[applicant] has shown the sincerest form of dedication towards his class, assignments and now his thesis project. He meets frequently to discuss his progress with the questions, and comes up with well-researched approaches for solving them--often going beyond the lengths I would expect of him. He is a sharp, self-motivated individual with commendable scientific attitude and eagerness to learn. His work is well organized and highly presentable.\n\nIn his bachelor’s project, [applicant] focused on formulating his research statement for a bioinformatics analysis of protein knots. My lab had solved a protein structure which potentially formed a knot structure was important in its enzymatic activity. We wanted to find out if the knotted structure confers structural or functional advantages, and if yes, what is the possible mechanism. [applicant] used his time to survey literature, create datasets, and create tools and pipelines to explore these objectives. His investigation led him to a few proteins that might be misclassified in reported literature. At the end of the junior year, all students were asked to make a final presentation of their project, and it was clear that [applicant] stood head and shoulders above the others in terms of what he had got done. Currently, [applicant] is working on verifying those leads.\n\nAt a personal level, I would describe [applicant] as curious by nature, who does not hesitate in reaching out or discussing questions with new people. During his undergraduate project, he added new improved methods for knot detection that could potentially reveal misclassifications due to improved numerical precision, in collaboration with external an external researcher. [applicant] also takes active interest in communicating his work and has given several talks related to his work in the intra-department Journal Club seminars.\n\n[applicant] has always expressed his desire to pursue a career in computational biology, specially approaches that integrate multi-omics, statistics, and methods development. He is an academically strong student (in top 2 of class) with demonstrated ability to pursue wide variety of problem. Overall, [applicant] unquestionably has my strongest recommendation. I am positive that he can adapt to the challenging environment you have to offer him and contribute significantly to your research. Not to mention, he will also share his energy, enthusiasm, positivity, and talent with his peers and collaborators. Please do not hesitate to contact me ([email]), should you require any additional information.\n\nWishing him a bright future.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_write_a_recommendation_letter&oldid=16823\n\""

Progress reaches the society only when change is observed. \nAwaaz has tried to bring a change in the institute and students’ lives every then and now. Some of the initiatives have been described below:\nSting Operation on Passport Bribery Case:\nA common complaint of the police officers asking for bribes was reported by a lot of students. The bribe amount varied from around 200 to 500 rupees. Awaaz conducted a sting operation and recorded the incident stealthily. The recording along with the report of a survey conducted by Awaaz was submitted to the concerned authorities and bribery was almost curbed.\nCV Module:\nWhen the ERP-based CV Module was newly introduced in the institute, the students faced a lot of problems due to the highly inefficient and buggy platform on which they were supposed to make their CV. Awaaz conducted a survey and prepared a report to submit to the administration. The report was considered by the administration and the CV Module was halted for a few days to come up with a better version of the same.\nSecurity Issue:\nIn 2016, the campus had way too less number of security guards and CCTV Cameras. The report submitted by Awaaz regarding the same was considered and led to a lot of changes on the security front in the campus.\nCleanliness Issue:\nOn the behalf of the entire student community, Awaaz demanded an increase in the number of dustbins in the campus and use of steel dustbins instead of plastic ones. The struggle bore fruits and the requests were considered by the institute.\nEvents Conducted\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur conducts two events in the span of one year:\nPanch Parmeshwar:\nIn the splendour of Spring Fest, Awaaz conducts ‘Panch Parmeshwar’, an event that attempts to bring the funniest and most delightful village memories back for the students. The participating teams are presented with an amusing and tangled case and the dispute is led to the Panchayat where they have to win the case by defending their side through relevant and humorous arguments.\nKavyanjali:\nPoets across the nation gather together for a poetic evening at the campus!\nSelection Procedure\nSelections to Team Awaaz are held once every year, for both first and second year students, in the month of August. Awaaz selects around 25 students in total just after the Freshers’ Introductory Seminar. The selection procedure consists of a group discussion task and a written test followed by a personal interview.\nAlumni of Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur\n2006\nAshutosh Kumar\nGautam Sinha\nRahul Ranjan Mishra\nRitesh Gupta\nVivek kumar thakur\nAshutosh kumar\n2007\nKumar Abhinav\nShyam sunder\nArunabh parihar\n2008\nPankaj Kumar Soni\nSumit Singhal\nAbhinav Prasad\n2009\nAvimuktesh Bharadwaj\nVarun Prakash\n2010\nAman Kumar\nAshutosh Kumar Mishra\nSiddharth Doshi\n2011\nMadhusudan\nAnurag Katiyar\nKunal Minda\nNishtha Sharma\n2012\nNishtha Sharma\nSimmant Ujjain\nSwati Das\n2013\nAnimesh Choudhary\nAmit Kumar Dalmia\nRohan Bhatore\nVaibhav Shrivastava\nSughandha\nSushil Rathi\nCharuvind Atre\nPushpam Bharadwaj\nRaja Paswan\n2014\nPrashant Jha\nSangam Trithraj\nVikas Kesari\nVikas Dubey\nGopinath Soren\nKunwar Akash\nNeeraj Kashyap\nGyaan Prakash\n2015\nNikesh Kumar\nKrati Aggrawal\nShubham Bisht\nManpreet Singh\nManish Choudhary\nPrashant Kartikey\nKrunal\nBhavya Kumari\nParbani Kisku\n2016\nPranay Prasoon\nAnjali Goyal\nPragati Patidar\nPriyanka Raj\nGyandeep Kumar\nShailesh Kumar\nVaidehi Bhardwaj\nAnkit Bansal\nRameshwar Jaiswal\nNancy Charaya\n2017\nShubham Sharma\nManoj Meena\nSiddhant Gupta\nKhushboo Kumari\nRamesh Thakur\nSumit Pandey\nAyush Pandey\n2018\nKaustubh Mirge\nNihal Gupta\nChirag Bariya\nSumit Pandey\nShubham Singh\n2019\nNawazish Parwez\nAyush Gautam\nSmita Mandal\nBhawana Bansal\nSubhajit Kumar Barman\nShashwat Mishra\nAstha Pandey\n2020\nRahul Raj\nSwapnil Singh\nSaloni Meshram\nSheet Kushal\nLovish Chopra\nNavin Kumar\nExternal Links\nhttps://facebook.com/awaaziitkgp\nhttps://www.instagram.com/awaaziitkgp\nhttps://youtube.com/user/awaaziitkgp\nhttps://issuu.com/awaaz\nhttps://linkedin.com/company/awaaz-iit-kharagpur\nContact us\nPhone No: Rishabh Raj : 9117337131\nEmail:\n[email protected]\nOR\n[email protected]\nEmail:\n[email protected]\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Awaaz&oldid=238409\n\""

        "title": "How to prepare for CFA level 1",
        "content": "(This guide was originally written by Shugun Patel(IM '16))\nThe\nChartered Financial Analyst\n(\nCFA\n) Program is a professional credential offered internationally by the American-based\nCFA Institute\n(formerly the Association for Investment Management and Research, or AIMR) to investment and financial professionals. A candidate who successfully completes the program and meets other professional requirements is awarded the\nCFA Charter\nand becomes a\nCFA Charter\n.\nContent\nCFA level I contains 10 topics (weightage in Level I exam) :\nEthical and Professional Standards (15%)\nQuantitative Methods (12%)\nEconomics (10%)\nFinancial Reporting and Analysis (20%)\nCorporate Finance (7%)\nEquity Investments (10%)\nFixed Income (10%)\nDerivatives (5%)\nAlternate Investments (4%)\nPortfolio Management and Wealth Planning (7%)\nPreparation Time\nOne month of dedicated study is enough to clear Level I. A candidate with prior knowledge in Basic finance is a plus point.\nIf you have other priorities and can’t give 1 month complete for preparation, a regular study of 1-2 hours everyday before 2-3 months of exam date is sufficient.\nMaterial\nSchweser\nstudy material is enough to understand and clear Level I. One can go through and solve official booklet (soft copy) of CFA Institute as well if you have enough time to prepare.\nPassing Marks\nIt is suggested to secure more than 70% in each topic to smoothly clear Level I. Candidates who have less than 70% in 1 or 2 even 3 subjects (less weightage subjects) have also cleared level I but it's unlikely.\nTopic Wise Guide\nEthical and Professional Standards\nThis is one of the toughest and easiest topic in CFA Level I. Toughest for some who find remembering rules difficult and get confused or apply\ntheir own logic in questions in these topic.\nEasy for those who go through the rules and sections and understand and remember the rules and the ambiguity attached with some questions. There are CFA lecture videos by\nArif Irfanullah\n, going through them for Ethics preparation is beneficial. You will quickly understand the content then you can refer to your Schweser booklet to solve more questions.\nQuantitative Methods\nMost of us (Kgpians) will find these section to easy to understand and study. You Complete the entire topics in 2 or 3 days, given that we have basic knowledge of probability and statistics. Schweser notes is more than enough for these topic.\nEconomics\nThese topic requires you to understand the concepts well. If you have basic knowledge in Economics, it will help you. Economics (subject) is compulsory in 2\nnd\nyear for some departments. These will give you basic macro and micro economic knowledge which will help you in your Economics preparation for CFA Level I. Also, Banking Theory and Practice (HS Dept) is yet another subject which you can opt as an elective or additional as these subject will help you understand Macroeconomic topics in CFA Level I Economics. Again, If you don’t understand the theory given in\nSchweser\n, refer to video lectures by Arif.\nFinancial Reporting and Analysis (FRA)\nFRA has the most weightage in level I and it is completely new topic for us. It has\nbasic accounting rules to follow and you need to remember two different accounting\nprincipal U.S. GAAP and IFRS. You should give decent time for these topic and\nDo make your own notes\nto refer while revising. These is very important for FRA as there are many rules and cases to remember. Refer to video lectures in case you\nare stuck somewhere. There is a course in VGSom which you can opt as an additional or elective Introduction to Financial Management (IFM). These course content includes Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Cash Flow\nStatement which can help you in getting acquainted with FRA for Level I.\nCorporate Finance\nNot a tricky topic or difficult as such. IFM from\nVGSoM\nmight provide you with some concepts given in Corporate Finance.\nEquity Investments\nThese is again a simple topic compared to other topics. Go through notes and\nquestions behind every chapter. Video lectures if required.\nFixed Income\nThis topic is comparatively more interesting and in level I the difficulty level for\nquestions in these topic is more compared to other topics. So, Read these topic\ncarefully, Solve questions and go through official CFA Study materials question as they are a bit tougher compared to\nSchweser\n.\nDerivatives\nDerivatives in Level I is just an introduction. You can finish studying it in a day or two.\nDerivatives and Risk Management Course by\nProf. Prabina Rajib\nin\nVGSoM\ncan be opt for to gain more knowledge in Derivatives.\nP.S. Ma’am is quite serious regarding attendance, Home Assignment and Presentations. But, the knowledge you ll gain after taking her course is worth the hard work involved.\nAlternative Investments\nAgain a small topic mainly theoretical. Don’t miss or neglect these topic as most of\nthe people have secured less than 70% in these section.\nPortfolio Management and Wealth Planning\nStudy materials will be enough to understand these topic. Again, Not a difficult topic to understand, but should not be neglected.\nSummary\nClearing CFA Level I is easy task. It is not at all a difficult exam. Study wisely, make your own short notes for quick revision in last week. Clear conceptual doubts through video lectures, additionals or electives mentioned, or simply searching on Internet. Most important is practice especially in Ethics.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_prepare_for_CFA_level_1&oldid=13782\n\""

        "content": "The University of Alberta Research Experience (UARE) is a research internship program allowing top senior undergraduate students from key partner universities to conduct research at UAlberta under the supervision of faculty members who are experts in their field. UARE placements are available during winter (January to mid-March) and summer (May to August) for a period of 10-12 weeks.\nUniversity of Alberta International provides full support for participants before, during and after their placement. A formal orientation, professional development seminars, academic networking opportunities, and a poster symposium are all offered to program participants.\nEligibility\nSenior undergraduate students (3rd or 4th year)\nEnrolled in an undergraduate degree program at a designated partner institution (Partner Institutions in India: IIT Bombay, IIT Kharagpur)\nHave a minimum Grade Point Average of 3.0 or B on a 4-point scale (or equivalent etc).\nPast UARE participants are ineligible\nThere are many projects in a number of disciplines like Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Biotechnology, Environmental Engineering etc.\nApplication Procedure\nThe projects for summer are typically posted on their website by mid-September. The deadline to apply for UARE Summer 2016 was October 31, 2015.\nYou must upload the following documents with your online application:\nLetter of intent\nScanned Official Transcript\nResume/CV\nTwo academic references, submitted directly from the referee via the system\nAcceptance Notification\nThe notification of acceptance generally comes as an email between mid December and February.  The official offer letter, along with the immigration package is emailed to the students by mid march.\nPost Acceptance\nStipend\nCurrently the scholars receive a total amount of CAD 5,000 (CAD 2,000 commitment from the UAlberta faculty member or department; CAD 3,000 is funded centrally). A lump sum of CAD 3,000 is given to the students immediately upon arrival. The rest of the stipend, CAD 2,000 is dispatched late June, after the students are granted tax exemption. All the expenses including air tickets, housing and food for the 8 weeks stay in the US are to be borne by scholars from the above mentioned amount.\nLocation\nUniversity of Alberta is located in Edmonton, capital of Alberta, Canada. UAlberta's main campus is located in the centre of Edmonton, just minutes from downtown and surrounded by the beautiful river valley. With a major transit station on campus, there is easy access to the city’s many attractions. During the internship, opportunities to participate in cultural and social events such as city festivals or day trips to nearby attractions are offered on a weekly basis. A trip to the Rocky Mountains is made available to every intern.\nHousing\nInterns are responsible for their own housing. A few students stay in the Lister Centre, but most interns stay in subleased apartments, which are cheaper and available on campus or right outside campus. Since housing is cheaper outside campus, a number of students opt to stay far from the campus and take a convenient 10-15 minute ride to the campus in the LRT. Subleases can be easily found by visiting facebook pages listing sublease ads. Facebook groups formed by the scholars also turn out to be extremely useful sources of information.\nVisa\nThe application process for Canadian work permit visa is smooth. The application process is clearly listed on the Canadian immigration and travel website. Ideally, the VISA is delivered to you within 2 weeks of applying. However, the processing time of a work permit visa is known to vary between 20 days and 2 months. Hence, it is in your best interest to apply as soon as you receive the award letter and all the supporting documents.\nSee also\nList of internship programs\nHow to get a visa to Canada\nExternal Links\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=University_of_Alberta_Research_Experience_Programme&oldid=10682\n\""

This paradigm emphasizes on the\nintegration of data, knowledge, and tools necessary for efficient knowledge\ndiscovery in the decision-making process associated with information extraction\nand computational intelligence. The aim of this course is to present an\noverview of different methods used in biomedical signal processing. Signals\nwith bioelectric origin are given special attention and their properties and\nclinical significance are reviewed. In many cases, the methods used for\nprocessing and analyzing biomedical signals are derived from a modeling\nperspective based on statistical signal descriptions. The purpose of the signal\nprocessing methods ranges from reduction of noise and artifacts to extraction\nof clinically significant features. The course gives each participant the\nopportunity to study the performance of a method on real, biomedical signals.\nIt covers principles and algorithms for processing both deterministic and\nrandom signals. Topics include data acquisition, imaging, filtering, coding,\nfeature extraction, and modeling.Objective: â¢To develop an in-depth\nunderstanding with the basic theoretical knowledge and practical experience\nfrom the area of biomedical signal processing.â¢To learn the fundamentals of\ndesign of biomedical signal processing system and its challenges to design the\nsensors of physiological variables in the wired and wireless paradigm.â¢To know\nthe various statistical techniques for processing and visualization of\nphysilological information on the digital hardware platform.Course\nContentCourse Overview: Review of Probability, Stochastic Process, and Signal\nProcessingPhysiology and characteristics of biomedical signalsNon-linear Signal\nProcessing, Morphological Signal processingBiomedical signal processing by\nrandom fractal theory: Long-range correlation and the Hurst parameter,\nStructure-functionâbased multifractal formulation, Cascade multifractal\nformulationBiomedical signal processing by chaos theory: Feature identification\nusing Lyapunov exponent, Feature identification using fractal dimension,\nFeature identification using entropy formalism (including Kolmogorov entropy,\napproximate entropy, sample entropy, permutation entropy)Analysis of Nonstationary signals: Non-stationary second-order statistics, Case-studies with\nHeart sound, murmurs, EEG rhythms and waves, knee joint vibration signals and\nbreath sound signals, Fixed segmentation (short-time Fourier transform),\nAdaptive segmentation-Spectral Error Measure, ACF distance, Generalized\nlikelihood ratio, ACF, SEM and GLR methods, RLS filter and RLS lattice\nfilterHeart-rate variability (HRV): Relationship with blood pressure, Diabetis,\nrespiration, renal failure, duugs, smoking alcohol, sleep, fatigue, age and\ngender with HRV.

Progress reaches the society only when change is observed. \nAwaaz has tried to bring a change in the institute and students’ lives every then and now. Some of the initiatives have been described below:\nSting Operation on Passport Bribery Case:\nA common complaint of the police officers asking for bribes was reported by a lot of students. The bribe amount varied from around 200 to 500 rupees. Awaaz conducted a sting operation and recorded the incident stealthily. The recording along with the report of a survey conducted by Awaaz was submitted to the concerned authorities and bribery was almost curbed.\nCV Module:\nWhen the ERP-based CV Module was newly introduced in the institute, the students faced a lot of problems due to the highly inefficient and buggy platform on which they were supposed to make their CV. Awaaz conducted a survey and prepared a report to submit to the administration. The report was considered by the administration and the CV Module was halted for a few days to come up with a better version of the same.\nSecurity Issue:\nIn 2016, the campus had way too less number of security guards and CCTV Cameras. The report submitted by Awaaz regarding the same was considered and led to a lot of changes on the security front in the campus.\nCleanliness Issue:\nOn the behalf of the entire student community, Awaaz demanded an increase in the number of dustbins in the campus and use of steel dustbins instead of plastic ones. The struggle bore fruits and the requests were considered by the institute.\nEvents Conducted\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur conducts two events in the span of one year:\nPanch Parmeshwar:\nIn the splendour of Spring Fest, Awaaz conducts ‘Panch Parmeshwar’, an event that attempts to bring the funniest and most delightful village memories back for the students.

It is often fondly recounted by several alumni on their trips back to IIT Kharagpur.\nLogistics\nOP happens in the starting months of the Fall semester, generally carries on till October\nOP happens in the common rooms of the halls\nThe main affected set of people are the second year students who have just entered the senior hall (or have stayed a dormant one year there already, in some cases)\nThe main set of people who are conducting this are 3rd year students, and they are led by the General Secretaries. There are 4 G.Secs: Social and Cultural, Sports and Games, Technology, and Maintenance.\nThere are three different places where the OP might happen: (a) Common Room (b) Dining Mess (c) Wing\nWing OP is considered to be the scariest, and is generally the venue for the creepiest and most humiliating of activities.\nCommon Room OP is about instilling respect in all the second year students for their seniors in the hall\nMess OP is about humiliating students in front of their other batch mates, and hence fostering a false sense of comradery among them.
