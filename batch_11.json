Each group's viva can go on to roughly 15 minutes and questions are mostly asked on different topic to each member of the group. The questions are according to experiments and, in worst cases, there could be cross questioning from the experiment your partner is being asked from. Below are some example questions:\nWhat is a low pass filter and a high pass filter?\nDraw the circuit for high pass filter with RC and RL components? Also draw the graph for it's characteristics.\nWhat is 3dB cutoff frequency? Write the equation.\nDraw the adder circuit.\nDraw the circuit for inverting Op-Amp configuration.\nWhy common emmiter configuration is used as amplifier?\nCause of Early effect.\nDraw the input output characteristics of C-E  amplifier.\nWhat is the need to study signal handling capacity of C-E amplifier?\nCIC Lab Test:\nA lab test is done in CIC soon after the viva for all the students taking the course. The test consisted of 25 questions (Autumn 2018) of normal difficulty and were do-able with just reading the lab manual and understanding the concepts.\nLab Test:\nIn the lab test, one member from each group is called first with the lab manual, and they are asked to perform some part of an experiment. It is followed by the same procedure for the next member. The student is supposed to perform some part(s) of the experiment and the following is provided:\n- Detailed objective for each part (NO PROCEDURE IS PROVIDED). E.g. Find signal handling capacity for the given circuit when load resistance is infinite and resistance across emitter is bypassed (from CE Amplifier experiment).\n- A diagram (specifically of the parts to be performed) of the circuit is provided.\nClassroom resources\n14ME Batch Course Repository\nLab manuals\nAdditional Resources\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nIn Dept\nIn Dept\nIn Dept\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nIn Dept\nIn Dept\nIn Dept\nFriday\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=EC29001:_Basic_Electronics_Lab.&oldid=228348\n\""

        "title": "2014-03-07 MT Hall Day Incident",
        "content": "On March 7th 2014, during MT Hall day students damaged furniture, threw them from the top floor and made graffiti on the walls. In some rooms fans were also bent. The event was widely condemned by authority and student community.\n[\n1\n]\nDetails\nImages:\nBent Fan\nThings thrown from top floor\nVandalized bed\nThe hall day proceedings started at about 7 pm as usual. This was the first hall day for the UG 1st year students (who joined the institute in July 2013). A soft rule was put in place requiring girls who had invited their male friends to come to the door and escort them inside. This rule was not enforced very rigidly. Security at the gates of the hall checked the ID Card of every student who was going into the hall.\nAfter entering the hall, students were milling around for about an hour or so, understanding the geography of the hall presumably and taking it all in, because this was the\nonly day\nthat they were going to be allowed inside the hall for the next 1 year. This was also the first time that they had a taste of the hall day culture. Much had been made of this tradition by most seniors from societies that about 1/4th of the UG 1st year batch were part of.\nAround 8:15 PM, trouble started when some unruly activities started on the top floor where some first year female students lived. Boys were being pushed out of the room and boxes of surf, tubes of toothpaste were being dumped and squeezed onto their clothes. Presumably, the girls residing in these rooms did not say anything to stop this distressing behavior (perhaps even vocally supporting it) and allowed the act to continue. Quickly, things escalated to a point where mattresses and pillows were being thrown from the second and first floors onto the garden on the ground floor which had been fixed for the Hall Day. Even until this point, this was nothing more than a joke. This is where the tone of things changed into a competition.\nMembers of various societies started forming human chains and singing songs and marching around the floors and the stair cases. These chains had both male and female members and they were going from a room of one of their members to another one of their members. Allegedly, all the members were from first year, and although seniors were residing in this part of the hall, they did not intervene.\nSome seniors from 3rd and 4th years were seen walking around the in the ground in the center of the hall where the mattresses were being thrown and trying to convince people vocally to stop throwing things and behaving in an unruly manner. This call to regain control and stop the events went mostly unheeded.\nThe whole destruction went on for about an hour unchecked, due to some gross mishandling by the MT Hall President, VP TSG and the hall security guards, who were present on the premises for the whole evening but did not act.\nAt 9:15 pm - 9:30 pm, the hall day was brought to an end (approximately 30 minutes before the scheduled end), and everyone was asked to leave. All the men were herded around and summarily expelled from the hall. The mood among most students was celebratory. It is safe to assume that the destruction that they had done and the consequences of the same had not yet sunk in. After the hall-day, discussion regarding what happened was mostly done with a fair bit of humor and the event was filed away in memory for nearly 2 weeks. Some girls whose rooms were trashed talked about how it was unfair for their LAN ports to be broken and their only fault being that they had invited their friends into their rooms.\nTimeline\nMT Hall Day 2014\n7th March, 2014\nFirst official communique from VPTSG condemning the event\n9th March, 2014\nFirst meeting between the VP TSG, TSG office bearers and UG 1st year batch\n19th March, 2014: 6 pm\nSecond meeting between the VP TSG, Hall presidents of several senior halls and\nentire\nUG 1st year batch\n19th March, 2014: 9 pm\nInterrogation of girls from MT\n-- TODO -- (This will be a range)\nList of students who were to be punished with 2 months of community service released\n-- TODO --\nA list of things that happened\nFans bent out of shape (see image)\nBeds thrown from as high up as the third floor onto the ground floor\nLAN ports broken\nObscene phrases on the walls of some rooms (references to the male and female reproductive organs using slang terms in English and Hindi)\nAftermath\nAdministration\nAt the time of this event, the following were the people who held different important positions.\nPosition\nOffice bearer\nPresident\nTSG\nProf. Joy Sen\nVice President\nTSG\nApoorv Jain\nUndergraduate Representative to the senate\nIshan Garg\nDean (Student Affairs)\nProf. N R Mandal\nHall President (MT Hall)\n-- TODO --\nHall President (SN/IG Hall)\nShriti Bhosale\nEmails sent by the VP TSG\nThe Vice President (TSG) at the time of the incident was Apoorv Jain. On 9th March, 2014, he sent an email to all students enclosing images of the destruction caused. He severely condemned this event. The attached images immediately found their way to Facebook, and subsequently to Quora where several questions asking \"why\" these events had happened at a prestigious institute such as IIT Kharagpur. As most first year students were dazed by the destruction they had enabled and participated in, no one had thought or been allowed to take pictures before being expelled from MT Hall. Pictures that did exist had not been widely circulated or posted on Facebook. So, in essence, if the VP TSG had decided not to include pictures of the destruction in his email, there would have been none in public circulation for anyone to look at.\nDear Students,\n\nThis letter is in regards to the recent occurrence of damage to institute property on 7th March, 2014 during Mother Teresa Hall Day. In a span of fifteen minutes, furniture in the rooms of several first year undergraduate students was either broken, damaged beyond repair or thrown from the top floors. Furthermore, the walls were defaced with obscene graffiti. The fact that few students indulged in such act of vandalism reflects poorly on the entire student community of IIT Kharagpur.\n\nThis heinous act of mass wreckage showed lack of respect for institute property and, more importantly, lack of character and morals in the offenders, and has left the student community of IIT Kharagpur equivalent of street ragamuffins. This kind of crude behaviour as shown in pictures attached is not expected of students of the forerunner of the IITs. IIT Kharagpur is not a mere academic institution, we boast of a rich fraternal culture, which is developed through a deep sense of gratitude towards the institute. Sadly, incident like this have raised a question on whether our freedom is compromising our civility and whether we deserve such infrastructural facilities.\n\nWe, the Office bearers of Technology Students' Gymkhana and all Hall Presidents are extremely disturbed by this irresponsible and dishonourable behaviour of our own students. Visibly, students have failed to capture the real essence of Hall Days. We hope students understand the gravity of the situation and refrain from such undignified activities in future.\n\nThank you\nWith Regards\nApoorv Jain\nVP,TSG\nOn 19th March, 2014, at around 8 am, he sent this email to all the UG 1st year students.\nDear Students,\n\nToday, Prof N R Mandal (Dean, SA) will address all the UG 1st year students regarding MT Hall Day incident. So, all the students are kindly requested to be present in Netaji Auditorium at 6.30 pm.\n\nThank you\n\nWith Regards\n\nApoorv Jain\nVP,TSG\nMeetings between the student community and the VP TSG\nFirst meeting\nOn 19th March, 2014, the whole UG 1st year batch (students who joined in 2013) was called for a meeting at Netaji Auditorium at 6:30 pm. Apoorv Jain sent out this email at around 8 am that morning.\nThis meeting was attended by then Dean (Student Affairs) Prof N R Mandal, then President TSG Prof. Joy Sen, VP TSG Apoorv Jain and a few hall presidents. The turn out at the 6:30 pm meeting was very less. (approximately 50-70 people out of a total UG 1st year batch of 1400 people)\nThe meeting was delayed and students who were present there were intimidated into manually calling their friends to the venue, this marginally increased the turn out. The intimidation was done by the VP TSG who was present there, along with some fourth year hall presidents who were visibly angry and disappointed with the turnout. Absurd threats were made against the few obedient students who had turned up. Eg:\nAgar tumhara pura batch yahan nahi aayega, to yahan pe jitne bhi log hain, tum sab pe DC baithegi. Phir udhar jaake jawaab de dena.\n(If your whole batch doesn't get here, all of you who are present here will be acted upon by the Disciplinary Committee. You can then explain your situation there.)\nAround 7:30 pm, the professors arrived at\nNetaji Auditorium\n. A long address followed. Students present at this meeting were informed that the 12 day delay was because of then DOSA Prof. N R Mandal being out of station and thus being unable to act on the events. This delay was not to be misinterpreted as an unwillingness to act. Allusions were also made to the VP, President and other professors of the institute getting phone calls from alumni regarding the MT Hall Day incident. One of the things that stood out at this meeting, which was discussed for several weeks after this meeting, was Prof. Joy Sen's famous reference to the 1979 Mel Gibson classic\nMad Max\n. He particularly pointed out the end of the 1979 movie where Mel Gibson's character Max loses control over himself, after losing his family, and kills several members of the gang that was involved in the death of his wife and his infant son. Prof. Sen's was trying to draw an analogy between the behavior of a few out of control freshman and the protagonist in a movie who does something explicable, but rather bizarre. While most people at this first meeting had not seen the movie Prof. Sen was talking about, it was clear to almost everyone present that he was grappling with what had happened and trying to make sense of it using the appreciated principle of \"life imitating art\"\nStudents present there were also informed by the VP TSG that there was widespread disappointment in the behavior of the UG 1st year students, and that since the General Championships had been suspended right after the incident on 7th March, there was considerable anger among students in senior batches.\nAll professors present at the meeting were irritated with the low turnout and left about 1 hour after the meeting started in an agitated state. Apoorv Jain then decided to convene a complete UG 1st year batch meeting at 9 pm that night. There was widespread panic about what the consequences would be. There were several threats (such as mass Disciplinary Committee action, barring from placement, etc) which were indirectly made by the VP TSG and other hall presidents present at the meeting. The ultimatum was to get the whole batch at Netaji Auditorium at 9 pm and then, the discussion would be about the possible recourse that could be taken to mitigate the event's fall out.\nSecond meeting\nThe second meeting began at 9 pm and saw much higher turnout, with almost the whole UG 1st year batch turning up. People were found in MMM and LBS Halls of residences literally running around calling their friends and everyone in 1st year to this meeting. There was widespread panic regarding the threats that had been made. Notably, none of the professors came to this meeting. The meeting was attended by the hall presidents of Patel, Nehru, MT, SN/IG, apart from then VP TSG. This was viewed as a scare tactic, as some of the hall presidents referred to the absence of Orientation Procedure / OP for first years was somehow responsible for this behavior. Their direct implication was that people were running around wild because they had not been \"trained in the ways of KGP\". Referring to the suspension of the GCs as a result of the main incident, one of the Hall Presidents said,\nTum logon ko pata nahi hain ki iska kya matlab hain, sab log bahut gusse mein hain. Agle sal jab tum log senior hall jaoge to tumhe pata chalega\n(You don't know about the importance of the GCs being suspended, everyone is angry about this. You all will face the consequences for this next year, when you go to senior halls)\nSome of the options discussed in this meeting included a reduced community service for the whole UG 1st year batch, so as to save a few people from getting a lot of the punishment. When the students present in the auditorium were asked,\nAre you all willing to take the blame and stay back and do community service for the summer, so that not just a few of your friends face really bad consequences?\n, a few students immediately shot down the idea. The general consensus among students who had not attended the hall day, had not witnessed the incident, and/or were completely not involved in the incident was that they should not have to pay with their time for the mistakes of a few groups of people.\nThe VP TSG made an effort to try to get traction for the shared punishment idea. He asked if anyone would like to defend it and try to convince their batch mates. Understandably, students who had been spotted by many people as being the main players in the destruction were in total support of this idea of shared blame to reduce the punishment. They were seen visibly confused and voiced their concerns with one student standing up and addressing the rest of the auditorium:\nDekh lo yaar, sab log lenge blame toh sirf ek mahina rehna padega, nahi toh pata nahi kya hoga.\n(If everyone takes the blame, the punishment will be very less and everyone would have to stay back only for 1 month. If not, we don't know what the punishment might be)\nTensions were even higher than at the previous meeting because for the first time Apoorv Jain said that one of the common punishments doled out after disciplinary committee hearings were \"semester backlogs\nwhich implied that a student will be disbarred from registering for one semester and hence would be unable to complete their course on time. Apart from this, this would also be in the official record of the student including the final grade transcript.\nConsequence\nA group of 27 1st year students were told to undergo community service for 2 months during the summer months of May and June 2014. There was no other official record made anywhere regarding this event.\n[\nunverified\n]\nDiscussion\nThe events of MT Hall Day 2014 were a classic case of the Bandwagon effect. The destruction was started by a small subset of people attending the Hall Day. It started as a joke, and eventually turned into a competition between the various societies on campus.\nInterestingly, some of the women who resided in the hall, who were acting as hosts in the hall day decided to preclude the possibility of destruction by locking themselves inside their rooms and not letting anyone in. Some of the male friends of these women who had locked their doors to outsiders then tried to fish them out of there by filling buckets with water and then throwing them into the room using the slit under the door. It must be noted that a similar method is used to lure cockroaches out of hiding spots in kitchen drains, that must definitely have been the source of this particular strategy.\nWhile some other women decided to give in, and some even participated in the destruction of their friend's rooms. Claims can also be made about this being a direct application of the herd behaviour in real life. There have been\nseveral\nriots in the past that have been attributed to this particular characteristic of human behaviour.\nOn a brighter side, there were people who were trying to stop this from happening. Shushman Choudhury (CS, '15) was on the ground floor and was trying to stop people from throwing down mattresses by shouting at them. He gave up after about 15 minutes of this (it was rather dangerous to stand on the ground floor where the possibility of a mattress hitting you is non-significant), but it must be said that it must have taken considerable courage to even try to do something like this against a mob, that for all practical purposes, had lost all control on themselves and had stopped computing the turn of events, the consequences of the same and the state of the hall as it stood around them.\nLess attention is paid to the aftermath and the administration's response to this event. The administration decided to witch-hunt a small group of people and decided to get a list of names and proceed with punishing them. They decided to talk to the women whose rooms were trashed in an attempt to get the names of their male friends who did the trashing out of them. This strategy didn't work out well at first. Most women flat out refused to talk. Soon, the administration started using the only chip they had: threatening the woman with disciplinary proceedings for not cooperating. Soon enough, it was clear to all the women that this was not going away and that they had to come up with names or get ready to face the heat of saving their friends.\nGiven a choice, several women chose to name a few friends who they thought would be wildly off the administration's radar and it would be very hard to actually punish them because it would be obvious to everyone that these people were not responsible, but the administration didn't care about this and went ahead and prepared the list of 40-50 people who were going to do the community service in the summer. This list had a few people who had been included because only the first name had been provided by the women and there were several people with that name in the UG batch. One such person got his father to fly out to Kharagpur and talk to the director directly about what was going on and why this kind of mob justice was being handed out. His name was removed from the list subsequently.\nThe names of some other people were also included in this list although their connection to the events was non-existent. People who had been at home during the weekend of the events or who had been in the hall for a very short period of time were on this list. Some people were able to get their names off the list.\nThe administration's tactics were simple: they set about intimidating 18 year olds into tattling on their friends. While many might imagine that in the same situation, they would have behaved in an honorable manner, one is forced to imagine what the conditions must have been like if nearly 50 names could be squeezed out of a population of highly un-cooperative women.\nSee Also\nHall Day\nReferences\n↑\n\"Open Letter of Condemnation | MT Hall day\"\n- VP TSG 2013-2014 Apoorv Jain\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=2014-03-07_MT_Hall_Day_Incident&oldid=97174\n\""

Although this lab course has no final practical lab test, there are certain features that make this lab a hard nut to crack as only 3-4 students per section get Ex (the number depends on your professor taking the lab).\nYou will be guided by the TAs about the experiement, however you have to setup the entire circuit on your own (TAs and Lab assistants can only help you with some connections). You have to take the readings in the fair PT sheets on the spot and get it signed by the TA then and there. Officially, you have to get the circuit diagram signed by the TA before starting the experiment. Since the TAs check your regular practical assignment, they look for the signatures and do penalise you for their absence.\nHowever the best plan for this lab assignment is as follows:\n1.Get sufficient PT sheets for all 6 assignments in the beginning of the semester from TechMarket. \n2.Write the Aim, Apparatus Used (from circuit diagram), Theory (from Internet or book 1-2 pages), related circuit diagram, Observation tables (leave them blank and keep sufficient space for them),Result page (with expt data portions empty) and the discussion questions along with answers(you can get them on\nhttp://notehub.in/\n). No need to write procedure.\n3.Do these in your free and peace time and you will reap it's benefits very soon.\n4.However bring only the circuit diagram and observation sheets of that particular day's experiment only.\n5.Further details regarding format and submission will be explained by your Prof on the first lab day.\nYour lab professor will have no role to play in this lab except your final viva. Depending on the kind of professor you have, the pattern of the test will vary. You may have a complete oral viva or a written-cum-oral viva. And in most cases, the viva goes on for 2-3 weeks. So you might get to know some of the questions from yours friends as they might be repeated quite often. Same goes for the written.\nThe best material to prepare for these Lab Vivas is the book Thareja. If possible read those extra portion which is not in your theory sylabus but might be asked in labs like working principle of various instruments,related calculations and some other extra stuff. But stress on the basic syllabus more strongly.\nFor better idea do go through this page:\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Electrical_Technology_Viva_Questions\nHow to Crack the Paper\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nInstiinfo Repository\nTime Table\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=EE19001:_Electrical_Technology_Lab&oldid=56500\n\""

Blooming with it come the innocent first years, unknowing and curious to explore the beautiful campus. Their wish is fulfilled by the Azad hall of residence by organizing KHOJ, a campus treasure hunt for inspiring the first years to explore the campus with friends as a game and make it one of the most memorable event of their stay in IIT KHARAGPUR. It was started in 2000. KHOJ is the first and the biggest event organized exclusively for the first years. Boys and girls of the campus equally participate in it with full zest and zeal. The students are required to form a group of five, and then the teams are given clues of a place in the campus. They are required to unlock the clues, reach the required place and then find the code hidden somewhere at that place. This is done many times until a team unlocks all the clues and is declared the winner and prizes rain in the event with many teams getting prizes just based on their luck! Though the winner of the event may be one team but the enthusiasm the first years show makes everyone a winner. The event brings with itself joyfulness in the entire campus and gives a first year opportunity to interact with his/her batchmates and the campus. The event continues to grow every year bearing a testimony of the saga of the AZAD HALL OF RESIDENCE.\nAlumni Contributions\n1)Mr. Supriyo Sircar(1987) - Basketball Ground\n2)Mr. Bhaskar Dutta (1970) - Music Room\n3)Mr. Subhendu Mandal (1995) - Football Ground\nAzad Hall Anthem\nAzad Hall of Residence is the only hall in IIT KGP to have a Hall Anthem and an Oath of Fire.

Listen to French music while studying for the exam, watch French movies, TV series etc. Enjoy the course as you learn French.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nUsually, the marks distribution changes from year to year.\nThe following was the one in 2019 Spring -\nMidSem = 20\nEndSem = 30\nAttendance = 10\nPlay = 15\nPresentation and Report = 15\nPoem = 10\nAttend all the classes. Greater than 8 absence and you get dereg'ed. Also the attendance carry marks.\nThe Play and PPT were group activities, make sure you practice both at least once. These are easy marks.\nAs for Midsems, make sure you can answer basic questions about the activities asked to do (Just read it, no use memorizing it). Simple Translations are asked.\nTo score higher, make sure that you learn the gender along with the words you learn, their plurals and be well versed the Present, Perfect and Imperative Tense of Verbs of GRP 1 and 2.\nFor Endsems, it will be similar as midsems with addition of irregular verbs adverbs, prepositions, framing moderately difficult sentences, passage - based question answering.\nBe comfortable with the important verbs like Avoir, Etre, Faire, Aller and the three verb forms. The questions will be asked in French itself, make sure that you go through the previosu years papers so that you can understand what exactly is being asked.\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nHugo's French in 3 months\nTime Table\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=HS30047:_French&oldid=86846\n\""

Concepts covered in this course is extension to Beam theory taught in First Year Mechanics(that's one part) just this time around structures are modelled as spring which are vibrating. And other is part is actually mostly mathematical modelling of vibrating structures.\nStudent Opinion\nThe course is tough if you are not regular with your classes. But if you are which includes going through Tutorials and regularly asking doubts in the classes especially for those parts where mathematical concepts related to Matrix algebra, orthogonality, etc. come. Do participate in the class and ask Sir to give examples wherever you think mathematical concepts are going over your head. Most topics will be Abstract i.e you have to memorize but in time you will understand what they mean when you will solve tutorial. Coming to its relevance the understanding that you gain in this course helps you to understand some of the software that is currently used in industry extensively such NASTRAN and PATRAN. Most of the software development that happens related to Aerospace Structures is based on the mathematical concept taught in this course. Not just vibration but the way mathematical concepts are applied here.\nHow to Crack the Paper\n1. Solve the tutorial and the Class assignments (Because at Prof. said he doesn't have time to make new problems). Both for mid sem and end sem\n2. For Mid sem especially do follow Book by S Rao\n3.

This school builds on the strong tradition of interdisciplinary research in IIT Kharagpur. Our multi-disciplinary approach will ensure diverse areas of research that include studies at the level of molecules (biochemistry, biophysics, molecular & structural biology) to organisms (cellular and developmental biology, microbiology and immunology). The overarching goal of this school is to elucidate the structure and function of biological molecules that influence the physiology of an organism, and more importantly apply these basic findings to the discovery of novel therapeutic solutions for various human diseases to enhance human health.\nWe will use state-of-the-art facilities to study biological macromolecules in both normal and diseased states. Biophysical methods such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, analytical ultra-centrifugation (AUC) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) will be used to study the molecular and structural basis of macromolecular functions. A few areas of interest are - regulation of transcription factors, DNA repair mechanisms, protein folding and mis-folding, intrinsically disordered proteins, enzyme catalysis and protein engineering.\nMolecular biology studies will be supported by strong research and training programs in cell biology, developmental biology and genetics. The common themes will include regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, intracellular trafficking, cell cycle and apoptosis, cell polarity and migration, cell-cell interactions, pattern formation and organ development.\nA major focus of our research is the discovery of therapeutic strategies for various human diseases based on our fundamental molecular and cellular biology research. We will study many important diseases including, but not limited to, cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, heart and respiratory diseases, diabetes and tuberculosis.\nFor further informations please contact at\n[email protected]\n.\n[\n1\n]\nProf.\nAmit Kumar Das\nis the current Head of the School.\nResearch Areas\nAgeing and neuro-degenerative disorders\nBiochemistry\nBiophysics\nCell adhesion molecules\nDevelopmental neurobiology\nReferences\n↑\nhttp://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/BS\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=School_of_Bioscience&oldid=17783\n\""

        "title": "How to prepare for TOEFL",
        "content": "Credit:\nVivek Rai\n, BT '17\nTest of English as Foreign Language\n(abbrv. TOEFL) is an English proficiency requirement test administered by Educational Testing Services (ETS), a non-profit organization based in United States. The test scores are often used by universities as an admission requirement for admitting non-native English speakers in undergraduate and graduate programs.\nTOEFL iBT\nTOEFL iBT is the Internet based examination where test is administered via computer. It is the more common form of taking TOEFL examination. The paper consists of 4 sections: Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing. Each section is scored between 0-30, and total test score is ranged between 0-120. There are no grades or class awarded. A percentile score is also available for different scores.\nPreparation Strategy\nAssessing current preparation\nUsually, the GRE score is a nice indicator of the preparation needed for TOEFL. A good score means relatively little preparation for certain sections of TOEFL, for example, Reading and Writing sections. However, one may till need to prepare to Listening and Speaking sections.\nKnow the time\nThe whole test can take up to 3 hours and 30 minutes. Each section is individually timed and subsections in each category have separate times as well.\nReading: 3-4 passages, 54-72 minutes\nListening: 4-6 lectures and 2-3 conversations: 60-90 minutes\nBreak: 10 minutes\nSpeaking: 4 questions: 12-17 minutes\nWriting: 2 tasks: 20 min and 30 min respectively\nThe number of question in each set varies depending on which set consists the experimental section. For example, you would either receive an extra section in Reading, or an extra section in Listening but not both.\nResources\nETS provides sample resources including audio files, reading comprehensions and scored responses.\nSections\nReading\nEach passage in Reading section is accompanied by 14 questions. The questions are simple choose-one, choose-multiple, re-arrange based on text, match-groups type. There's about 20 minutes time for each set, though the entire set is timed at once. That is, if you have 3 passages, you will have a total time of 60 minutes. It is relatively easy to score Reading section since passages are not easy.\nProtip:\nDo not wait to read all the passage before answering. Read question, lookup answer, repeat.\nListening\nListening section consists of two kinds of questions: Lectures and Conversations. You'll have to hear 4-6 of lectures and 2-3 conversations to answer questions about material discussed. You are allowed to take notes during the listening tasks.\nProtip:\nAvoid making too detailed notes. The questions asked are high-level in nature. For example, What was the purpose of the lecture, Which concept was introduced. Not like, What happened on the Friday the 13th at 5 pm.\nSpeaking\nConsists of 6 questions: 2 independent speaking and 4 integrated speaking tasks. You typically have to speak for 30-60 seconds (varies by each question) for each question. Some questions contain an integrated lecture, and you are asked to answer a question related to the lecture.\nProtip:\nPractice by recording your own voice to sample questions and listening it. Note where you get stuck. The idea is to keep it simple and clear without using too fancy English. There is no need to be too loud or fake an accent.\nWriting\nConsists of two questions: One independent writing about an issue (30 minutes), and other integrated writing (20 minutes). The independent issue writing is very similar to GRE analytical writing section, except that you are not required to demonstrate persuasive writing. The integrated writing portion consists of a passage, followed by a lecture that discusses aspects of the passage. You are required to write about a question that combines the material from both passage and lecture.\nProtip:\nPractice simple essay writing for general issues under timed conditions.\nScores\nTOEFL iBT scores arrives in about 10-15 days. Typically, most universities have cutoff varying between 80-100. There are hardly any universities that require scoring above 100 as cutoff. So, any score above 100 is pretty good. In fact, scoring above 110 will put in 90-percentile group. Also, unlike GRE, TOEFL requires you to select target universities before giving the test. You are required to fill in the codes of universities  for which you will be sending the scores by 10 p.m (local time) of the previous day of the test date. By doing so you will get an opportunity to send scores for free to 4 universities. After 10 p.m there will be late charges. More info can be found\n[1]\n. Make sure you have selected your target universities before taking the exam.\nThe\nmost important\nthing about scores, is the score in speaking section. Generally all the good universities will offer you a\nTeaching Assistantship (TA)\nif and only if you have a speaking score of\nmore than or equal to 27\n(\ngenerally most of the Indians get stuck up in the range 22 to 26)\n.\nSo getting a good score in speaking section and having reasonably good grades will give you an edge over other applicants in funding. Of course there are other forms of assistantship's like fellowships and Research Assistantships (RA) which you will get based on the strength and content your application. Lastly there should be no much of a worry if one cannot score the threshold in speaking. Having an overall good score will also give an equal advantage, but one will have to clear an exam similar to TOEFL(designed according to the universities teaching standards) after getting an admission. Generally these tests will happen in the orientation week of the graduate school and are very easy compared to TOEFL.\nSee also\nHow to prepare for GRE\nHow to apply to graduate school\nExternal Links\nTOEFL Sample Questions\nTOEFL Test Preparation: The Insider’s Guide\nTOEFL Mock Tests\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_prepare_for_TOEFL&oldid=146409\n\""

A student would be allowed to register in an additional subject only if he/she satisfies the pre-requisite, there is no clash in the timetable and the class size permits.\nOnce a student has registered in an additional subject, the grade obtained (including F-grade) in that subject would invariably be recorded in his/her grade card. The credit contribution of these additional subjects to the computation of CGPA, however, would be considered as nil.\nThe GPA of the additional subjects is separately calculated and indicated in the grade card.\nA student can drop an additional subject following the proper procedure within 3(three) weeks from the commencement of the semester; otherwise, the subject will remain registered and the subject will be mandatorily reflected on the Grade Card even with F grade.\nThere is no scope for a supplementary examination in an additional subject.\nStudent can get\nMinor\nfrom other departments by completing required number of credits and full filling the requirements.\nMicro Credits\nMicro-Credit courses are one credit courses having duration of 3‐14 days offered during the semester or during evening or free slots available during weekdays or even weekends that are not declared holidays in some special cases when students are available.\nThe subject will be counted for total credit requirement for completion of degree in special cases subject to recommendation of the Head and approval of Dean (UGS) with due reasons recorded.\nThe subject and grade will be mentioned in transcript / grade card and will be used to compute CGPA for additional subjects and will be shown as ACGPA. Failures will be marked by F grade. There will be no supplementary examination for such subjects. The F grade will be changed only if the subject is offered again and the student is allowed to register and clear the subject. However, in case the micro-credit is accepted as a subject contributing to the curricular requirement, it will be accounted for in the CGPA calculations.\nA student is normally not expected to take more than 2 such courses in a semester. The subject may also be a part of minor and micro‐specialization.\nReferences\nUG Regulation Document\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Additional_course&oldid=19084\n\""

Despite the fewer number of its residents, the SN/IG Hall has carved its own niche in both academics and in various socio-cultural and sports events and competitions organized by the students’ Gymkhana. The Hall is also actively involved in all major students’ events such as the Spring Fest, Kshitij etc. In addition to representing IIT Kharagpur in various teams in Inter-IIT competitions, its residents have also consistently held offices at Technology Students’ Gymkhana.\nInfrastructure\nThe hall is divided into A, B, C, E, F, G, H, N, NR, W, S blocks. in four different buildings.\nOther facilities\nSports facilities\nThe has its own basket ball court, well equipped gym, table tennis facilites.\nMusic room\nThe hall has a well furnished music room for singing and dance practices.\nHall Library\nThe hall has its own library managed by the student body that issues books to the hall borders for a complete semester.\nFood and eateries\nThere is night canteen, Store, fruit stall and Nescafe in the hall.\nCommon rooms\nThere are two common rooms in the hall- Old and the new one.

To name just a few, Dr Parvati Dev (B.S.1968) Director, Stanford University School of Medicine, and President, IIT Foundation, late Dr Nina Saxena (B Tech 1992), Dr Chaitali Sengupta (B.Tech 1992), systems architect in Texas Instruments and one among the 100 Top Young Innovators of 2004 (MIT Technology Review), Dr. Sanghamitra Bandopadhyay, Indian Statistical Institute, Dr Serene Bannerjee (B.Tech 1999) of INTEL, Lachmi Khemlani (B Arch,.1990), author, instructor at UC Berkeley, researcher, and consultant in CAD. etc.\nThe Hall allows its residents a taste of both freedom and responsibility as the affairs of the hall are managed by the students themselves.

The ILU part really takes a lot more time (cleaning diyas, wiring them, drawing chatais, etc...) a shortage of man-power on the actual event date greatly restricts plans. However, SN has been doing very well in Rangoli off-late. A picture of the '96 rangoli (3rd position) is given above.\nHall-day  -\nThe one time of the year when you can bring guests to your room (without having to be critically ill!). The hall is decorated with lights and all, everybody buys a lot of food, and the E-TMS very obligingly puts up a performance. Authorities are usually worried about 'uninvited-guests'... so residents have to set up an extensive 'security' system to check for invitations.\nFresher's welcome-\nJust as the name suggests, it marks the end of the OP. Restrictions have now made it very hard to have an OP of any sort but the fresher's welcome still is the greatest source of entertainment.\nSophomore Party -\nJust as the name suggests, it marks the welcome of sophomores in the hall. Nowadays freshers are allocated IGH and onboarding of second years happens in snig not freshers anymore so we have this party and its there first party in the hall and it is the greatest source of entertainment and it marks the beginning of hall bonding\nFinal year Farewell -\nThe final year farewell is markedly sober... ending in massive senti sessions with the final years handing out perps awards. It involves an extensively planned programme, a catwalk, a 'Miss SN' competition and some 'best senior in such and such awards'. This is accompanied by special dinner (where the mess ammas actually put up a good show) and ends in a lot of tempo shouts and dancing.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Sarojini_Naidu_/_Indira_Gandhi_Hall_of_Residence&oldid=238369\n\""

Class notes are more than sufficient to prepare for exam. But the slides as mentined earlier do not have much content in it. Attend the classes when he is taking an example from reaseach papers because there will surely be questions from that part. You cannot find these answers on google easily.\nClassroom resources\nSlides and handouts will be provided by the professor. But the handouts have too much information ( which will not be useful in exam) and the slides have very less information( which is useful in exmas). He willnot deregister you but can fail you.\nAdditional Resources\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nMT ANNEX-4\nTuesday\nWednesday\nMT ANNEX-4\nMT ANNEX-4\nThursday\nFriday\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=MT41023:_Composite_Materials&oldid=103648\n\""
