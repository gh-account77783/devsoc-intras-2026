        "content": "Alma Matters is a 2.5 hours documentary featuring the life of a student at IIT KGP. It attempts to cover most facets of student life in 3 episodes (discussed below).\nThe series tries to unfold issues less known to people outside IITs, and discuss cultural aspects specific to Kharagpur. Medium is a mix of Hindi & English, overall tone of the show is informal. Mode of the show is via student, professor & alumni interviews talking about their overall experience, or experience during certain events. The series features prominent comedian and alumni Biswa Kalyan Rath.\nThe documentary was released on May 14, 2021 and featured as the top watched show on Netflix for the first week [\ntweet\n].\nEp 1: Independent Variables\nThe first episode talks about the motivation behind setting up the first Indian Institute of Technology, and what India expects of them.\nLike most number games,\nCGPA\nis a number that often controls access to resources and opportunities (defining terms like the talented \"chaggi\",\"satti\", \"atthi\", \"nehli\").\nIt briefly brushes the importance of halls in which the students spent most of their college life, and the motivation towards winning the prestigious\nGeneral Championships (GC)\n.\nExplains the\nstudent committee\n, its election and their role in organising on-campus activities like GC.\nExplores the gender ratio on campus (1 girl :9 boy), and how it creates a sexist bias towards dismissing women's opinions on campus\nWhy there was never a girl candidate contested for the highest student post, Vice President of Gymkhana.\nHaving a girl candidate contest for the post and win Secretary Sports and Games, and what challenges / bias the candidate faced.\nEp 2: Escape Velocity\nEpisode 2 largely covers the placement process for final year students, what kind of stress that brings - it closely follows few students living in the same wing, and them getting placed.\nOne of the highly appreciated points about the episode has been its honest depiction regarding placement packages and the proverbial \"1 crore package\" - which 5 students of a batch of 2000 receive, while most students land a package of 8-12 lakhs.\nDisparity among hiring companies - most companies hire for a data profile, and people keep their course work for 4/5 years aside and prepare for a job that their academic work does not necessarily prepare them for.\nCompanies hiring for \"core profile\" (directly related to study / department) are few and hire a handful of students - the rest of students are not left with options.\nEp 3: Young's Modulus\nThe final episode of the series starts with one of the most significant cultural experiences in KGP -\nIllu\nand\nRangoli\n.\nDuring the two semesters when the documentary was filmed (2017), the campus had 5 suicides in one year, the show covers the open house held to address this and the concerns for mental health.\nThe series ends with the final few days of students before they graduate - and enter a world they have tried to prepared for.\nReferences\nIMDB page\nNetflix page\nYoutube trailer\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Alma_Matters&oldid=146284\n\""

It is a research group sponsored by\nSRIC\nas part of\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics\n. The aim of the research group is to drive the state of the art of aerial robotics forward and participate in international competitions like\nIARC\n. Students from all departments and years have been part of this including undergraduates and post-graduates. The principal Investigator for the project is\nProf. Somesh Kumar\nand it is mentored by\nProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay\nand Prof. D.K. Pratihar.\n[\n1\n]\nHistory\nARK was an idea that started as a\nDream-a-Bot\nproposal which was an initiative by\nTechnology Robotix Society\nin 2013. The\nTRS\nheads then liked the idea and decided to go ahead with it and ordered a simple quadrotor chassis and ESCs worth INR 7000 only. With absolutely no prior knowledge about aerial robots or control systems, couple of students started tinkering with IMUs and ESCs spoiling them, burning them and eventually learning how to use them. However, a lack of direction to the project often demotivated the people involved. So, in early 2014, the direction was decided i.e. to participate in\nIARC\nwhich was a much further goal compared to the situation then. With newly found direction, the small group started with attempting to fly the chassis and almost got it when the ESCs and IMUs burnt stalling for months. In August 2014, one of the students bought an AR Drone during his internship.  This sped up work by a huge margin as students now could divide into two team - software and controls, the former working on the purchased drone and the latter on flying the chassis. \nIn October 2014, the idea of\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics\nwas floated and students working on this attempted to get funded through it.  Aditya Agarwal made a research proposal and roped in\nProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay\nand Prof. D.K.Pratihar as mentors for the project and applied for funding. Mrinal Mohit pitched in by taking his BTP on Visual SLAM from aerial drone under\nProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay\n. The proposal was accepted and the fund was received in\nSRIC\nin January 2015 and the group\nARK\nwas officially formed.\n[\n1\n]\nA complete lab setup was finally ready by August 2015 for testing drones indoor and finally a new drone with a new chassis was first hovered in the lab in September 2015.\n[\n1\n]\nList of Student Coordinators\nList of Past Coordinators\n[\n2\n]\n:\n2014: Aditya Agarwal (EC '15)\n2015: Soumyadeep Mukherjee (CH '16)\n2016: Gaurav Gardi (PH '18)\nActivities\nList of activities ARK is involved in\n[\n1\n]\n:\nInternational Aerial Robotics Competition\nIARC is the longest running collegiate aerial robotics challenge in the world.

It is a research group sponsored by\nSRIC\nas part of\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics\n. The aim of the research group is to make autonomous soccer-playing robots and participate in international competitions like\nRobocup\nand\nFIRA Roboworld Cup\n. Undergraduate students from all departments and years are a part of this team. The principal investigator for the project is Prof. A.K. Deb and it is also mentored by\nProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay\n, Prof. D.K. Pratihar and Prof. Sudeshna Sarkar.\n[\n1\n]\nHistory\nThe roots of KRSSG lie with\nTechnology Robotix Society\nas one of the alumni, Aamir Ahmad interned at the\nInstitute for Systems and Robotics (ISR)\nunder\nProf. Pedro Lima\n(former trustee, Robocup Federation), convincing him to bring Robocup to India. Robocup@India challenge was organised by IIT Kharagpur in 2009. This event was the first of its kind in South East Asia and with this India joined the elite body of only 18 nations worldwide to host such a league. Students of IIT Kharagpur itself participated in this event, forming KRSSG. Following the event, KRSSG got faculty attention which prompted Prof. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay and Prof. Sudeshna Sarkar to formally take it up as a research project under them in 2010. This gave KRSSG its first funding from the institute and students started to join the group. With Sanjiban Choudhury and Kaustubh Tripathy taking it as their Bachelor's and Master's Thesis Projects, KRSSG soon grew to expand to a group of 10 students aiming to participate in FIRA 2010. KRSSG participated in FIRA 2010 with purchased robots, held in Bangalore with Sanjiban as the sole representative since it was during mid-semester exams. Although the team was eliminated in the first round, the international exposure proved to be very useful.\n[\n1\n]\nFIRA 2013 Team\nFollowing this, the team started to design their own chassis and circuits. KRSSG then next attempted to participate in FIRA 2012 in Bristol, UK. The team, led by Gaurav Rathi, were all set to leave when their visa was denied. The next iteration, FIRA 2013, was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia which saw successful participation. The mechanical design, circuit fabrication, control code and the AI were all developed by students of the group. FIRA Malaysia was also KRSSG's maiden entry into the Simurosot simulation league. KRSSG was one of only two teams who were using self-manufactured robots in the event along with Team Sahas from IIT Madras. Moreover, FIRA 2013 was the first time an Indian team won a match in FIRA.\n[\n1\n]\nFollowing this, KRSSG participated in FIRA 2014 Beijing, China and FIRA 2015 Daejeon, South Korea.\n[\n1\n]\nList of Student Coordinators\n2009: Kaustubh Tripathi (CS '10)\n2010: Sanjiban Choudhury (EE '11)\n2011: Bittu Sarkar (CS '12)\n2012: Gaurav Rathi (CS '13), Shourav Chakravarty (AE '14)\n2013: Harsh Surana (ME '14), Shourav Chakravarty (AE '14)\n2014: Ashish Daga (ME '16), Soumyadeep Mukherjee (CH '16)\n2015: Akshay Gupta (CS '16), Raunak Dhaniwala (EC '16), Seemant Jay (ME '16)\n2016: Abhinav Agarwalla (MnC '18), Kumar Abhinav (CH '18), Kaustubh Mundhada (EC '17), Dhananjay Yadav (ME '17)\n2017: Gunjan Sengupta (MT '18), Ankit Lohani (CH '18), Rishabh Jain (EE '18)\n2018: Sudarshan Sharma (EC '20), Mayank Bhushan (CS '20), Ankush Roy (ME '20), Buridi Sree Aditya (CS '20)\n2019: Tanishq Jasoria (MnC '21), Ashish Kumar Gaurav (MnC '21), Shivam Kumar Panda (ME '21), Shubhanan Shriniket (CS '20)\n[\n1\n]\nActivities\nRoboCup Four Wheel Robot\nRoboCup Small Size League\nThis project was a result of the success of the RoboCup India Challenge in the campus in August 2009 and led to the formal creation of KRSSG. The aim of this project is to develop a team of autonomous robots in accordance with the rules of International RoboCup Small Sized League. Some notable highlights of this project are the development of a team of omni-directional robots with linear and chip kicker that shoots and chips a golf ball.\n[\n2\n]\nRobocup 3D Humanoid Simulation league\nThe RoboCup 3D Simulated Soccer League challenges control of virtual humanoid team of robots competing against one another in a simulation of the rules and physics of a game of football. This aims to control different kinds of humanoid robot models which has a field of view and also simulates communication between players like in real world soccer. KRSSG started working on this league in early 2015.\n[\n2\n]\nFIRA Mirosot\nThe aim of the project is to develop a team of autonomous robots in accordance with the rules of RoboCup Small Sized League and the Mirosot league of the World Championship conducted by Federation of International Robot-soccer Association (FIRA). This involves development of a team of differential drive robots. KRSSG developed two versions of the Mirosot robots and participated in 4 FIRA Roboworld Cups.\n[\n2\n]\nFIRA Robots\nFIRA Simurosot\nFIRA Simurosot is a simulation league of differential drive robots playing soccer. KRSSG started working on this after 2010. KRSSG has participated in Simurosot in3 FIRA Roboworld Cups.\n[\n2\n]\nHumanoid Robotics\nKRSSG has also started working on humanoid robotics. With students working on simulation league and also trying to get a Darwin Mini playing soccer, KRSSG is also working on designing it's own humanoid and getting it to play soccer.\n[\n2\n]\nCode-o-Soccer\nCode-O-Soccer is a coding competition conducted by Kharagpur RoboSoccer Students' Group in the month of October, the main aim of the event is to introduce the concept of autonomous soccer playing robots in students mind and motivating students to create a challenging strategy using the provided API on a three vs three robot match for which robots are provided by KRSSG.\nIt is going national for the first time in 2015 in collaboration with IEEE.\n[\n2\n]\nWorkshops\nKRSSG also has conducted workshops in IIT Kharagpur with IEEE and Intel to spread the culture of robotics in India and also to display it's work and skills.\n[\n3\n]\nIntel Workshop Presentation by KRSSG\nTeam Structure\nKRSSG Team is divided into four sections:\n[\n2\n]\nAI Team\nAI or Coding Team is the team that develops the strategy and high level control of the robot(s).

It organises the annual Space Technology and Astronomy themed fest,\nNational Students' Space Challenge\n[\n1\n]\n(NSSC) every year since 2011.\nspAts\nignites a passion for space exploration at IIT Kharagpur by organizing talks, discussions, stargazing sessions, lectures, and presentations.\nThe group publishes a bi- semester newsletter, '\nThe Moonwalk\n', which features on latest ventures in space technology and astronomy related articles and developments.\n[\n2\n]\nHistory\nThe Space Technology Students' Society was founded way back in 2008 by a group of students extremely enthusiastic about the frontiers of space technology. It was formed as an official student body under the Kalpana Chawla Space Technology Cell (KCSTC). Since then, the society has grown in size and activities. The idea of a national level space-oriented fest was conceived and thus implemented as the National Students' Space Challenge (NSSC) in the year 2011. NSSC has been successfully organised for twelve more editions since then.\nA subgroup of spAts, the FQTQ team which is a dedicated Astronomy discussion group was formed in 2016 under the guidance of Siddhant Singh.\nFunctioning\nThe student body of spAts is divided into two subgroups - the core teams consisting of Design team, Tech team and Management team (which is more concerned with management and outreach) and the FQTQ team (which is more based on Astronomical discussions and applications). spAts organises sky-gazing sessions, space-themed discussions and talks, webinars, lectures, presentations and publishes the bi-semester newsletter, \"the moonwalk\" for the people in the IIT Kharagpur community. The teams also organise the National Students' Space Challenge during the months of September-October.\nSelection Procedure\nspAts organises its selections during late August, once per year that is aimed only for the newly joining freshers for a continued membership till the end of the members' tenure. spAts organises an introductory seminar before the selections, where the functioning of the society as well as about NSSC is presented.\nThe interested candidates join as Junior Coordinators (JCoords) who conduct the NSSC. For the JCoord team, the candidate's technological, management, communication skills etc. are considered.\nLater, selections for joining the spAts team happen, where interested candidates select one portfolio from the FQTQ team, Design team, Tech team and Management team where emphasis is given on prior knowledge in the specific portfolio, presentation skills, previous experience with the concerned technologies and knowledge in the fields of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Selections are done in three rounds, an initial interview, a task round and a final interview where the task submissions are reviewed.\nOrganisational Structure\nspAts is mainly comprised of its two subgroups - the Core teams and the FQTQ team. Each subgroup have their own undertaking tasks but mainly the whole team collectively organises the NSSC fest.\nCore teams\nThese teams are mainly responsible for Management, Outreach, Communication, Publicity, Sponsor handling, Design, Web Design and Finance for the fest and the other activities spAts organises. The core teams consist of the Design team, the Tech team and the Management team\nFQTQ team\nFQTQ stands for From Quarks to Quasars, which describes the team more oriented to astrophysics in general. They hold periodic discussions and presentations on various topics along with sky-gazing events, open talks, webinars and content development.\nNSSC\nConducting the fest remains a major task for the whole spAts team. The team structure is as follows -\n5th and the 4th years comprise the Steering Committee (SCom)\n3rd Years are the Heads\n2nd Years function as Sub-Heads for the various events\nFirst Years contribute as Junior Coordinators (JCoords) for the fest\nList of Activities\nspAts organizes a lot of activities within the campus, as mentioned below.\nInduction Workshop\nThe spAts team interacts with the new coming Freshers batch during the Induction Programme through a series of presentations and workshops. In 2018, presentation on the life cycle of stars, the ever endless universe; and hand-on experience through water rocket lift-off workshop was conducted. The workshop received a positive response from the participants.\nNational Students' Space Challenge\nThe\nNational Students' Space Challenge\n, abbreviated as\nNSSC\n, is an annual space-themed fest organised in the month of September-October since the year 2011. It is India's first and the largest space technology and Astronomy themed fest. The whole spAts team is indulged in organizing the fest.\nFor more details find it on -\nNSSC\nSky-Gazing Sessions\nspAts also works to popularize astronomy among the people in the KGP community. Hence it organizes sky-gazing sessions every semester and also to cover exciting astronomical events, like the super blood red moon 30th January, 2017.\nSpace Month\nEvery Year spAts observes the month of March as Space Month, where a series of open discussions, webinars quiz or presentations are held. This space month primarily aimed to bring and contribute towards recent developments in space technology.\nThe Moonwalk\nThe Moonwalk is a bi-semester newsletter brought by the spAts team. It includes articles written on several astrophysical ideas, new perspectives arising in space and planetary sciences, recent developments in the field, contributions by eminent scientists over the world and discoveries.\nAwards and Achievements\nCompetition\nVenue\nAbout\nYear\nPosition\nAstro Quiz, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi\nTeam name - \"TheKGPCrux\"\n2019\nGOLD\nExploring the Interstellar, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi\nObservational astronomy based event\n2019\nSILVER\nScientists of Utopia, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi\nCase study event\n2019\nSILVER\nScientists of Utopia, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi (Online)\nCase study event\n2021\nGOLD\nAstro Quiz, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi (Online)\nSpace Quiz Event\n2021\nGOLD\nInternational Astronomy and Astrophysics Competition\nOnline\nEeshaan Sethia (Subhead) - International Runner Up\n2022\nNational Topper\nReferences\n↑\nNSSC\n↑\n\"Reaching for the stars\"\n.

Attendance was a major factor in grade distribution, as well as going to department for assignments on occasional weekends. The semester exams are also modeled on his assignments. It is crucial to solve the questions carefully otherwise you will not get the correct answer in first try, which is what matters in exam. As for the overall course, it is easy to get B but difficult to rise up to A/EX and also to drop to C/D.\nAutumn 2016\nTaught by:\nPawan Kumar\nHe taught merely about puzzles, gave us a handful of assignments which required logical reasoning rather than the COaA concepts. Furthermore, there was a huge weightage on attendance, he definitely took attendance for the 8 AM classes and discarded the attendance if the class strength was more than 50%. He tries to fit a normal curve on the marks distribution for grading. This means that only 2-3 students get EX, but no one gets F too, and most of the class ends up getting B or C grade. No books were specified. The best thing was labwork (It carried attendance). That was the best learning experience. He would give you a simulation of Computer Architecture and you would have to think of logic to solve typical problems.\nNishnik\n(\ntalk\n)\nHow to Crack the Paper\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nNC342\nNC342\nTuesday\nNC342\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=MA31009:_Computer_Organisation_And_Architecture&oldid=103630\n\""

The department and its alumni have important and strategic links with universities round the world and major shipyard and dock organizations in our country. In addition to teaching and training at the various levels of bachelors, masters and doctoral programs, the Department is also actively involved in various research and industrial projects sponsored by government, research organizations and industry. Some of the sponsored projects include Standard Hull Design for Mechanised Craft, Energy Audit of Ships and Scheduling of Propeller Maintenance, Development of Design Rules for Composite Ships and Boats, Computation of 3D Ship Motion and Sea Load. Ocean Engineering & Naval Architecture is a discipline that embraces diverse areas of engineering sciences. In a broad sense, this discipline is concerned with design, development, operation and planning of systems that operate in the marine and ocean environment. Areas of study under this include marine vehicles for cargo and passenger transportation, offshore activities, ocean mining, ocean and marine hydrodynamics, harnessing of non-conventional energy sources etc., reflecting the diversity of the field. In order to provide a multidisciplinary knowledge base, the course curriculum is framed by integrating many disciplines in engineering sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, humanities and management. The academic programs prepare students for a highly rewarding career in this rapidly expanding field. The academic and research programs are designed emphasizing on cutting edge knowledge in the subject areas of marine structures, hydrodynamics, ocean environment, hydroelasticity, offshore technology, design of marine vehicles & systems, coastal engineering, marine production and planning, coastal processes.

        "content": "(This guide was originally written by Shivam Kumar Jha[CS '22])\nThis guide explains in step-by-step approach how you can file an Income Tax Return for your parents, and use the documents procured to submit as Income Declaration Proofs. As per\nthe official document\n, dated 14.07.2020, ITR documents are accepted as valid proofs. This is the easiest method of all in order to provide proof of income that can be completed online.\nThe process is completely online, is super easy to fill for anyone with basic financial terms knowledge (like income, deductions, etc.) and can be completed in half an hour for each filing.\nWho Can File ITR\nEveryone with an income, no matter whatsoever the amount, can file an ITR online very easily. Below are the necessary requisites:\nShould have PAN Card\nShould have their AADHAR Card Linked With the PAN Card\nPrimary bank account (in the name of the person you are filing for) should be linked with the PAN Card\nShould have their phone number linked with their AADHAR Card\nShould have detailed information about their income and income sources; having Form 16 makes the process much easier.\nNOTE: For people with zero income, a small amount of income like Rs. 5000 can be shown while filing the ITR in the gross income field. Your filed ITRs are verified against the bank account and AADHAR card linked with the PAN.\nHow To File\nA really easy way to file ITR is to use an online service like\nClearTax\n. Below are the steps you can follow:\nRegister yourself on Cleartax or login if you are already a member. You can also file ITR directly on offical website\nhttps://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/home\n.\nChoose to file ITR.\nCorrectly fill all the details; most of the fields are self-explanatory, take help of your parents or your friends if you get stuck.\nFile the ITR; you'll get your \"Acknowledgement Number\",\nkeep this safe\n.\nGo to\neverify ITR online\nand enter the PAN, Acknowledgement Number (received on filing for the PAN you entered) and the fiscal year.\nChoose \"Verify With AADHAR OTP\". You'll get an SMS with OTP, enter it.\nAfter the verification, which takes from minutes to hours depending on the traffic, you'll receive an ITR-V document on your email address which you entered while filing. This document is what you need to submit.\nRepeat the process for both your parents,\ncombine the PDFs\n, and upload as income proof in ERP.\nYou absolutely need to submit ITR-V for both your parents or your submission will be rejected.\nNOTE: Cleartax saves your details and makes it easier to file the next year when you need the documents again.\nNOTE: In case of a genuine reason for not being able to submit both parents' document (single parent, etc.), please upload corresponding document(s) proving the same alongside the ITR-V and, if it is rejected, please send a mail to Assistant Registrar mentioning all details.\nSee also\nHow to file RTI to get information\nHow to get a visa to USA\nHow to claim your medical expenses\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_file_ITR_for_income_declaration&oldid=113843\n\""

        "title": "How to prepare for CFA level 1",
        "content": "(This guide was originally written by Shugun Patel(IM '16))\nThe\nChartered Financial Analyst\n(\nCFA\n) Program is a professional credential offered internationally by the American-based\nCFA Institute\n(formerly the Association for Investment Management and Research, or AIMR) to investment and financial professionals. A candidate who successfully completes the program and meets other professional requirements is awarded the\nCFA Charter\nand becomes a\nCFA Charter\n.\nContent\nCFA level I contains 10 topics (weightage in Level I exam) :\nEthical and Professional Standards (15%)\nQuantitative Methods (12%)\nEconomics (10%)\nFinancial Reporting and Analysis (20%)\nCorporate Finance (7%)\nEquity Investments (10%)\nFixed Income (10%)\nDerivatives (5%)\nAlternate Investments (4%)\nPortfolio Management and Wealth Planning (7%)\nPreparation Time\nOne month of dedicated study is enough to clear Level I. A candidate with prior knowledge in Basic finance is a plus point.\nIf you have other priorities and can’t give 1 month complete for preparation, a regular study of 1-2 hours everyday before 2-3 months of exam date is sufficient.\nMaterial\nSchweser\nstudy material is enough to understand and clear Level I. One can go through and solve official booklet (soft copy) of CFA Institute as well if you have enough time to prepare.\nPassing Marks\nIt is suggested to secure more than 70% in each topic to smoothly clear Level I. Candidates who have less than 70% in 1 or 2 even 3 subjects (less weightage subjects) have also cleared level I but it's unlikely.\nTopic Wise Guide\nEthical and Professional Standards\nThis is one of the toughest and easiest topic in CFA Level I. Toughest for some who find remembering rules difficult and get confused or apply\ntheir own logic in questions in these topic.\nEasy for those who go through the rules and sections and understand and remember the rules and the ambiguity attached with some questions. There are CFA lecture videos by\nArif Irfanullah\n, going through them for Ethics preparation is beneficial. You will quickly understand the content then you can refer to your Schweser booklet to solve more questions.\nQuantitative Methods\nMost of us (Kgpians) will find these section to easy to understand and study. You Complete the entire topics in 2 or 3 days, given that we have basic knowledge of probability and statistics. Schweser notes is more than enough for these topic.\nEconomics\nThese topic requires you to understand the concepts well. If you have basic knowledge in Economics, it will help you. Economics (subject) is compulsory in 2\nnd\nyear for some departments. These will give you basic macro and micro economic knowledge which will help you in your Economics preparation for CFA Level I. Also, Banking Theory and Practice (HS Dept) is yet another subject which you can opt as an elective or additional as these subject will help you understand Macroeconomic topics in CFA Level I Economics. Again, If you don’t understand the theory given in\nSchweser\n, refer to video lectures by Arif.\nFinancial Reporting and Analysis (FRA)\nFRA has the most weightage in level I and it is completely new topic for us. It has\nbasic accounting rules to follow and you need to remember two different accounting\nprincipal U.S. GAAP and IFRS. You should give decent time for these topic and\nDo make your own notes\nto refer while revising. These is very important for FRA as there are many rules and cases to remember. Refer to video lectures in case you\nare stuck somewhere. There is a course in VGSom which you can opt as an additional or elective Introduction to Financial Management (IFM). These course content includes Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Cash Flow\nStatement which can help you in getting acquainted with FRA for Level I.\nCorporate Finance\nNot a tricky topic or difficult as such. IFM from\nVGSoM\nmight provide you with some concepts given in Corporate Finance.\nEquity Investments\nThese is again a simple topic compared to other topics. Go through notes and\nquestions behind every chapter. Video lectures if required.\nFixed Income\nThis topic is comparatively more interesting and in level I the difficulty level for\nquestions in these topic is more compared to other topics. So, Read these topic\ncarefully, Solve questions and go through official CFA Study materials question as they are a bit tougher compared to\nSchweser\n.\nDerivatives\nDerivatives in Level I is just an introduction. You can finish studying it in a day or two.\nDerivatives and Risk Management Course by\nProf. Prabina Rajib\nin\nVGSoM\ncan be opt for to gain more knowledge in Derivatives.\nP.S. Ma’am is quite serious regarding attendance, Home Assignment and Presentations. But, the knowledge you ll gain after taking her course is worth the hard work involved.\nAlternative Investments\nAgain a small topic mainly theoretical. Don’t miss or neglect these topic as most of\nthe people have secured less than 70% in these section.\nPortfolio Management and Wealth Planning\nStudy materials will be enough to understand these topic. Again, Not a difficult topic to understand, but should not be neglected.\nSummary\nClearing CFA Level I is easy task. It is not at all a difficult exam. Study wisely, make your own short notes for quick revision in last week. Clear conceptual doubts through video lectures, additionals or electives mentioned, or simply searching on Internet. Most important is practice especially in Ethics.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_prepare_for_CFA_level_1&oldid=13782\n\""

By all accounts, the protest was a peaceful one and was being organized to show solidarity with the students of Aligarh Muslim University, who were on a hunger strike against a laathi charge conducted by the police against them.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\n[\n4\n]\nThe protest was being organized by a student group called the Ambedkar Bhagat Singh Study Circle, IIT Kharagpur. This group is not registered with the gymkhana as a recognized society. They organized the event leveraging social media and a mailing list. The event was called\nSolidarity Gathering for AMU\nand it's main aim was to show people around the country that students from all pockets opposed the laathi charge on the students of AMU.\nThe then-President of TSG, Prof. William K Mohanty, sent an institute-wide email with the subject \"Unauthorized Political Event\" saying\nWe expect that students of IIT Kharagpur will not participate in any such event. TSG does not support any such activity.\nDespite this email, the protest continued when 40 students turned up at the venue at the arranged time and tried to conduct a peaceful protest. Several SIS security officers (number unconfirmed) were deployed near the Gymkhana right before the arranged time for the protest.

This is to inform you that such events are completely illegal and have no sanction of institute authority. IIT Kharagpur is an institution of national importance and we do not encourage any activity which escalates tensions in the society in the name of political affiliation, religion, caste and region. Our sole aim is to promote development of science and technology and nationalistic fervour among students.\n\nWe expect that students of IIT Kharagpur will not participate in any such event. TSG does not support any such activity.\n\nBest wishes\n\nWilliam K. Mohanty\nPresident, TSG\nIIT Kharagpur\nEmail on a mailing list sent by ABSSC, IIT Kharagpur\nTime:\nWednesday 16 May 2018 09:22 AM\nSubject:\n[spark] Attack on free speech at IIT Kharagpur\nDear All,\n\nThe Hizli jail housed in the IIT Kharagpur campus had hosted numerous revolutionaries who have laid down their lives in order to establish freedom and democracy for their motherland. The same campus witnessed a mockery of democracy when a peaceful gathering of IIT students was attacked by the security personnel of IIT Kharagpur. It all started with a circular issued on the 14th of May, 2018 asking students to obtain permission from relevant authorities before exercising their right to freedom of speech and assembly. Later, on the same day hundreds of security guards were posted at the gymkhana to prevent a group of students from expressing solidarity with the students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) sitting in hunger strike against the brutal lathicharge carried out on them on the 2nd of May that left 20 students injured.\n\nThe circular issued by the competent authorities on the 14th of May goes against the student's fundamental right to freedom of assembly and speech. The purpose of any protest is to voice ones resentment against the authorities in power and the act of asking permission for the same while facing threats and with all possibilities of a denial defeats the objective of such an exercise in the first place.\n\nIt needs mentioning that in the protest march organized for Asifa in IIT Kharagpur, a gathering of 400 individuals were restricted from raising their voices against the barbaric perpetrators of the crime. At a time when the entire country was standing for a cause, the students of an “Institute of National Importance”- IIT Kharagpur were asked to remain silent. However, the students without paying heed to the intimidating tactics of the administration completed a rally and raised their voices for justice.\n\n Be it the institutional murder of Rohith Vemula in HCU, the brutal repression of students in JU during Hok Kolorob or the recent harassment of female students in BHU (and in numerous other instances), Ambedkar Bhagat Singh Study Circle along with other progressive student voices have always protested against the silencing of democratic voices and the autocratic high handling by institute authorities across different institutions in the country.\n\n In the present instance, 40 students braved the threats from the Dean of Students Affairs to stand for justice for their friends sitting in hunger strike against brutal police oppression at the Aligarh Muslim University. The assistant security officer, Mr. Sushil Kumar Choubey literally went to the extent of heckling a student by force while he was trying to enter the JC Bose Hall of residence. Such an act speaks volumes regarding the undemocratic and intolerant attitude of the administration and the free hand given to security personnel to deal with dissent in the campus.\n\n Earlier during the day, the Dean of Student Affairs, Prof. Somesh Kumar labelled the organizers of the protest as “anti-national” elements and accused them of bringing disrepute to the institute. Unfortunately, such is the times that any act not conforming with the diktats of the ruling dispensation is termed as “anti-national”. The remark is not only derogatory but also exposes the extent to which the authorities in power can stoop down to harass students fighting for justice and equality. We strongly feel that even few years back “anti-national” was not a word that was used so casually as has been done in recent times. While Mohammad Hamid Ansari, the former vice-president of the country have stood by the protesting students of AMU, students from IIT Kharagpur in solidarity with them were branded “anti-national”. Is standing in solidarity with the students in hunger strike opposing against the entry of armed right winged goons in an academic campus “anti-national”? Will the act of ignoring the brutal reality of our times really make us better individuals?\n\n The mail circulated by the Dean of Student Affairs, Prof. Somesh Kumar accused the organizers of being politically motivated and therein he has raised his concerns regarding the affiliation of IIT Kharagpur being used for such protests. It is to be noted that in spite of the institute despising all things political, there are significant right wing activities going on in the campus and there are facebook groups using the IIT affiliation for the same.\n\n Next, while discussing the point of “activities that escalate tensions in the society in the name of political affiliation, religion, caste and region” it should be kept in mind that the different institute talks and lectures graced by different Hindu monks, promotes a particular religious belief and in turn vitiates the secular atmosphere of the campus. We are sure that there are good aspects of other religion too if AT ALL religious activities needs to be carried out in the institute premises. This kind of majoritarianism definitely adds in (if not escalate) tensions in the society. Next, when Darwinism is under attack, we definitely look forward to the institute authorities for the upliftment of scientific temper and critical thinking as opposed to the promotion of some organizations and individuals engaged in business models of spiritual corporations (read Art of Living, ISKON).\n\n Lastly, while discussing instilling of “nationalistic fervor” among students, we should always keep in mind that dissent is the cornerstone of a healthy and functioning democracy. An academic campus that doesn't promote free speech and progressive thinking is definitely not dedicated to the service of the nation.\n\n Keeping the present situation in mind, we challenge Prof. Somesh Kumar to present us with evidence that proves that we have done anything that defies the Constitution of the country. Hereafter, we demand that -\n\n 1) Prof. Somesh Kumar must withdraw his “anti-national” statement and refrain from making such comments in the future.\n\n 2) Mr. Sushil Kumar Choubey should publicly apologize for arrogant behavior and manhandling of students.\n\n3) And finally, we urge the administration to re-establish the fundamental rights granted to all citizens of the country by the Constitution in the campus premises. \n\nSome images related to the incident can be found in the following link.\n\n https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zizNqebDMUeL_46Joqs8dHQI7-s4nxxi\n\nRegards,\n\nTeam ABSC.\nReferences\n↑\n\"AMU row: Tear down Jinnah's portrait, says Muslim Mahasangh chief; up…\"\n. 2018-05-17.

Go ahead! A peaceful course with less workload.\nBut if you are interested in learning about cognitive science via this course, DON'T TAKE IT. Course contains shallow discussions, biased examples, naive explanations for a lot of things. That is not the way psychology should be taught or learnt.\nInstead try the following courses if you are interested about human brain\nHS20002 General Psychology\n: Introduction to General Psychology. Basics of Psychology are discussed. Interesting things can be learnt about human behaviour.\nEC60007: Computational Neuroscience\n: Understanding brain from a computational and mathematical point of view.\nTime Table\nCheck the ERP Slot.
