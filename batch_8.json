        "content": "Minutes of the meeting from MetaKGP's first meetup for 2017-2018\nTime and venue:\n2100 hrs at Veggies\nDuration:\n2 hours\nAttendees:\nNaresh Ramesh\nSiddharth Kannan\nArun Patro\nAyush Goyal\nNishant Nikhil\nAthitya Kumar\nKaustubh Hiware\nHemant Kumar\nMinutes/TLDR:\nDecide potential contestants for the upcoming elections\nAsk Hemant Kumar (sophomore) about what he feels are the drawbacks/issues with MetaKGP\nDiscuss possible improvements to the Wiki, with detailed discussions on a review system for all subjects.\nDiscuss the state of the Dashboard and its individual components (especially Cab Centrale and Cab booking portal).\nDiscuss dates and moonshots for the upcoming HackDay\nPitch new projects to be taken up this semester\nDiscuss administrative issues including the need for a professor mentor, funding and a permanent room for MetaKGP.\nCreate an agenda for the month\nCreate a list of potential contestants\nA list of current active members was created whom the current Election Coordinator (EC) Arun Patro will be contacting.\nA sophomore's views on the current drawbacks / issues with MetaKGP\nThere is not enough motivation to contribute to the Wiki. Initial contributors get worn out soon.\nThere are not enough contributors to the Wiki.\nThe Wiki should contain 'funda' from graduating seniors to preserve their learnings from their 4 years in the campus that can be beneficial to the newer batches.\nThe Wiki doesn't always have original content and has a lot of material copied over directly from other sites.\nA huge number of courses (majorly electives/breadth subjects) are not yet listed on the Wiki.\nThe state of MFQP\nThe current system in place to collect question papers feels complicated and acts as a major barrier to new contributors. Moreover, there are no 'instructions' on the current site describing how to add new question papers.\nHemant Kumar will be working to fix this. He has proposed to solve it using a simpler upload portal, which he will be discussing on our Slack channels before starting work.\nThe state of the Wiki\nA major suggestion from Arun Patro and Ayush Goyal was that the Wiki should have a review system in place for all courses. A long discussion ensued on the same, and the following was decided:\nA course review system should be in place where students can leave their reviews and ratings for each course. To start with, Arun Patro will be creating a google form through which volunteers from the group can each fill reviews for at least 5 courses from their department. This reviews will eventually be channelled back to the Wiki manually. This could prove as a starting point for future contributors to leave reviews.\nAyush Goyal will be working on a portal through which students can upload notes for a course (which will be uploaded to archive.org). These notes will be linked on the course page. A future addition to this could be a way to leave a rating on these notes so as to sort them by rating later on.\nThe state of 'The dashboard'\nA dashboard was created by 4 members from MetaKGP during Inter-IIT Tech Meet at IIT Kanpur. This dashboard is to be released to the general public (i.e. KGPians) sometime this year. Some of the individual components of the dashboard were discussed in further detail:\nERP Authentication\nNaresh Ramesh will be working with Siddharth Kannan to encrypt the user's ERP credentials (used for components like MFQP) on the dashboard before sending it through the network.\nKGP Cab Centrale\nAimed at replacing the current Facebook group by the same moniker used by KGPians, KGP Cab Centrale should ease the process of finding partners for Cab pooling. This component of the dashboard was implemented completely during the Tech Meet and will be made public by the end of the week to the KGP public. Key functionalities included creating postings and searching using from/to location, time, time flexibility and the number of available seats as parameters.\nCab booking portal\nA cab booking portal was also created during the Tech Meet, that worked on the principle of giving the Cab Drivers in KGP an app to indicate their current availability. A page would be available on the dashboard that shows the list of registered drivers and their mobile numbers, alongside their current status. This idea will now be pivoted to indicate the live status of restaurants instead, which is more feasible. This idea is currently in low-priority and will be worked upon next semester.\nBuy/Sell portal\nTo be worked on by Ayush Goyal, Rameshwar Bhaskaran, Athitya Kumar and Naresh Ramesh\nHackday\nThe first Hackday for the year will be held in the 3rd / 4th week of August (To-be announced). Some of the moonshot ideas for the HackDay that were suggested during the meeting were:\nUse MetaKGP's Wiki data to train a Word2Vec for KGP\n\"Google Maps for KGP\" that can be created using the Google Maps API and links Wiki articles to locations on the map\n/r/place for KGP\nFoundation for NUSMods for KGP\nOther existing/new projects\nYouTube caching within KGP\nThe idea is to create a caching system within KGP that aims to bring down the total bandwidth usage within campus by using cached data when available for YouTube videos. Nishant Nikhil and Naresh Ramesh have started work on this, and will soon make the work public.\nMigrate 'Listen To This KGP' under MetaKGP\nListen To This KGP is a popular Facebook group where KGPians share their favourite music through YouTube links. Naresh Ramesh is working on a standalone site that will exist alongside the Facebook group that fetches the content posted on the group and creates playlists and smart filters through filters like user, artist, genre, etc.\nAdministrative decisions\nElections\nThere was a discussion on whether the current system of having elections every 4 months was too frequent, and should be done every 6 months instead. The discussion ended with choosing to continue with the current system.\nProfessor involvement\nGetting a professor as a mentor for MetaKGP was considered and will be discussed further on the Slack channel. The initial response to the idea was positive for the decision.\nTransition into a Gymkhana society\nThe pros and cons of moving to a Gymkhana society were discussed. The issue stemmed from the issue of insufficient funds for MetaKGP right now, and the realisation that depending on funding from seniors will not work out in the long term. Discussion to be continued on the Slack channels.\nThe need for a permanent room for MetaKGP\nThis is possible only if the previous point is satisfied. The motive would be to increase overall developer productivity when working together on projects. Not high priority.\nAgenda for the month\nRedirect metakgp.org to metakgp.github.io, which will be improved upon by Kaustubh Hiware to better describe MetaKGP and its projects\nArun Patro to circulate the Google form for course reviews\nNaresh Ramesh to deploy the dashboard as is, and to release Cab Centrale.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Metakgp:Meetups/2017-07-27&oldid=21844\n\""

Each group's viva can go on to roughly 15 minutes and questions are mostly asked on different topic to each member of the group. The questions are according to experiments and, in worst cases, there could be cross questioning from the experiment your partner is being asked from. Below are some example questions:\nWhat is a low pass filter and a high pass filter?\nDraw the circuit for high pass filter with RC and RL components? Also draw the graph for it's characteristics.\nWhat is 3dB cutoff frequency? Write the equation.\nDraw the adder circuit.\nDraw the circuit for inverting Op-Amp configuration.\nProf Gaurab Dutta\n:\nHe will give a sheet with 2 questions written on it. You have to solve the question. In case there is some error or anomaly in your answer, he will start asking you stuff. If everything is correct, not a single word conversation will take place.\nQuestions:\nA 4 quadrant table was given with one axis as V(CE) and other V(BE) for an npn BJT. Write the regions of operation in each quadrant\nDetailed graph of NPN BJT output characteristics (Early Effect was to be mentioned too)\nWorking of Zener diode\nWorking of Full wave (centre-tap and bridge) rectifier\nCIC Lab Test (Common for All):\nA lab test is done in CIC soon after the viva for all the students taking the course. The test consisted of 25 questions (Autumn 2018) of normal difficulty and were doable with just reading the lab manual and understanding the concepts.\nLab Test (Common for All):\nIn the lab test, one member from each group is called first with the lab manual, and they are asked to perform some part of an experiment. It is followed by the same procedure for the next member. The student is supposed to perform some part(s) of the experiment and the following is provided:\n- Detailed objective for each part (NO PROCEDURE IS PROVIDED). E.g. Find signal handling capacity for the given circuit when load resistance is infinite and resistance across emitter is bypassed (from CE Amplifier experiment).\n- A diagram (specifically of the parts to be performed) of the circuit is provided.\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nTuesday\nIn Dept,In Deptt.\nIn Dept,In Deptt.\nIn Dept,In Deptt.\nWednesday\nIn Dept,In Deptt.\nIn Dept,In Deptt.\nIn Dept,In Deptt.\nIn Dept,In Deptt.\nThursday\nFriday\nIn Dept,In Deptt.\nIn Dept,In Deptt.\nIn Dept,In Deptt.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=EC29003:_Introduction_To_Electronics_Lab.&oldid=64456\n\""

Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya Hall of Residence is known for its strong sense of community and camaraderie among its residents. The hall has a capacity of more than 2000 boarders and offers a variety of amenities, including multiple common rooms, a music room, a library, a technology room, and sports grounds. This hall of residence lies between\nLal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence\nand\nLala Lajpat Rai Hall of Residence\n. It consists of four blocks: DSK Block, RR Block, SDS block, and HK block. It has a canteen, hair salon, xerox centers, juice Shop, and many general items shop beside the cycle stand of SDS Block. The hall council members are elected from amongst the boarders for a year. Last election took place on 19 August 2023 via ballot paper in HK block common room.\nHall History and Culture\nThe hall culture is a vital component of the fabric of IIT Kharagpur. The hall you reside in plays a pivotal role in your personal growth and development, refining your character from a youthful student to a mature and sophisticated individual. Historically, the strength of the hall culture was believed to be proportional to its age; however, the students at Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya Hall of Residence defied these expectations and left an indelible mark on KGP history. The students exhibited remarkable determination and discipline, which enabled them to secure a commendable fourth position in the Illumination 2019 and second position in the Illumination 2022 competition.\nUndoubtedly, the senior-junior culture is a charming aspect of KGP culture, and Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya Hall of Residence is renowned for its supportive and empathetic senior students. The seniors are always willing to lend a helping hand and provide guidance whenever needed, fostering an open and approachable atmosphere in the hall.\nCouncil Members (2023-24)\nHall President - Gurpreet Singha\nSecond Senate Member - Akarsh Upadhyay\nGeneral Secretary: Technology - Suryawanshi Vivek Bapurao\nGeneral Secretary: Alumni Affairs - Mali Pruthviraj Vithalpant\nGeneral Secretary: Mess-01 - Harshit Patel\nGeneral Secretary: Mess-02 - Shiva Kumar\nGeneral Secretary: Maintenance - Sanmati Shastri Jain\nGeneral Secretary: Social and Cultural - Parv\nGeneral Secretary: Students Welfare - Balasaheb Ramkrishna Mule\nGeneral Secretary: Sports - Akshaykumar C Deshmukh\nGeneral Secretary: Library - Ayush Shrivastava\nStudent Activity Rooms\nHK - COMMON ROOM\nHK - WELFARE ROOM (S-213G)\nHK - SPORTS ROOM (W-317G)\nHK - HALL LIBRARY (S-313G)\nHK - READING ROOM (S-313G)\nDSK - COMMON ROOM\nDSK - HALL LIBRARY (E-313G)\nDSK - READING ROOM (E-324G)\nSDS - COMMON ROOM\nSDS - TECH.

It is now known as\nMetahub\n. The permanent hub address is\ndc.metakgp.org\n.\nHistory\nThis section requires\nexpansion\n.\nIn March 2016,\nThe Scholars' Avenue\npublished a story covering the gradual decline of the hub.\n[\n1\n]\nAbout\n\"HiT Hi FiT Hai\" hub intends to provide service to users willing to share \"legal\", \"non objectionable\" content. However the hub only provides a \"connectivity layer\" and a message board for the users and has no control over items shared or posted.The hub takes no responsibility for, does not expressly or implicitly endorse, and does not assume any liability for any content submitted by the users. The user, and the user alone is  responsible for their activity on the hub. By entering into the hub you agree to these terms and conditions. The hub scripts are all work of admin and operators and all rights regarding it are reserved to respective authors.\nHub Details\n[\n2\n]\n:\nHub Address     -\ndc.metakgp.org\nAdmin               -  proffapt\nOperators         -\nGODs               -\nVIPs                 -\nTerminology\nHHFH: Abbreviation of HiT Hi FiT Hai.\nMirror: Mirroring means sharing the files that you have downloaded from DC. It is expected from all the users that they mirror all the stuff. This is the easiest way to contribute to HHFH.\nLeecher: Those users who have a negative effect on the DC network by having a very poor share ratio, downloading much more than they upload. Leeches don't leave their DC client open to mirror the file after their download has completed. Some leeches intentionally avoid uploading by using modified clients or excessively limiting their upload speed.\nUptime: Time period for which a user is online.\nDC MC: Stands for DC main chat.\nMagnet: Magnets exists only for files and not for directories. Different files have different magnets, same files have same magnets. Right click on any file and select Copy magnet link.\nMods: They are the moderators of HHFH. Ask on DC MC for more info.\nBasic Rules\nMinimum limit for connecting is: 0 GiB. For searching and downloading: 100 GiB for now.\nSharing porn/linking-to-files-on DC which are marked NSFW is strictly prohibited.\nDon't use offensive language in common chat room. Don't spam in common chat room. Help make it a safe/riskfree hub for everyone.\nFake Sharing is NOT allowed here. Anybody found sharing fake will be banned immediately.\nDon't share crap like Windows and Program Files directory. You can be banned for 1-3 hours.\nNO upload speed limiting is allowed here (can be banned for this).\nAdd your Name Tags only at the end of filename and not before it.\nAll users are expected to mirror their downloads. Those who do not mirror could be subjected to bans depending on their leeched content.\nNick registration\nYou can register your nick with a password. Registrations are generally opened on weekends.\nRegistered users can\n:\nChat on main chat.\nAdd requests for any stuff.\nAccess Buy and Sell.\nHow to register your nick\nSearch your nick in the users tab.\nRight click on nick and select register nick\nA prompt appears wherein you need to set password, be careful as it asks only once for password.\nRestart the DC++ client and you will be greeted with a screen where you need to enter your password.\nMinimum file share\nThe minimum file share is set to 0 GiB for a short while when a new college term starts, to allow students to build up their share. After this initial period, a minimum file share size is imposed with the aim of increasing the availability and replication of files shared (mirroring). Users with a file share size less than this limit cannot search or download files, but can still access other features.\nThe current minimum file share size is\n100 GiB\n.\n[\n3\n]\nFeatures and User Commands\nAccessing user commands\nUser Commands\nOffline message to user : If a user is offline, message to them can be sent via this command. Nick of the user must be known to use this command.\nFile report : Fake/Misnamed/Personal/Program files can be reported via this command to VIPs. Enter the magnet of the file and mention why this file is reported.\nRegistration : This command helps user to register a new nick, change password of existing nick and delete an existing nick. Registrations are generally opened on weekends, watch out for Hub Topic to know when registrations are open.\nChat History : Retrieve upto 100 recent messages of main chat. Alternatively, '+history x' can be typed in main chat, where x=[1,100].\n[BOT]Info Command\nGuestbook : Express views about HHFH. Can be used to view previous entries and add new entries.\nBuy and Sell : View, add or delete any buy or sell requests.\nRequests : There are 3 options, namely view, add and handle. Add requests for any stuff that is not available on DC++. It is advised to search at least 3-4 times at different timings before adding a request. Notify the user who requested about the status of their requested item via Handle command.\nSuggestions : Recommend stuff to fellow users.\nNews : News forum of HHFH.\nThing Delete : Notify fellow users before deleting an unique stuff that you have. Fellow users are recommended to mirror that stuff.\nMiscellaneous\nBrowsing the latest content with single command / single click.\nFour separate chatrooms supporting anonymous chats, user subscription, listing subscribed users, denying messages from unsubscribed users, message logging and Individual chat history.\nYou can access the latest database of HHFH in your DC client or in the browser at\nHHFH webpage\n(the proxy needs to be bypassed). \"Bhaat forums\" are also hosted at the same IP.\nTips and Tricks\nSearch for alternatives: Right-click on any file and select 'search for alternatives' option to find other sources of same file.\nBrowse/Get file list: Right-click on any file and select 'Browse file list' to see location of file. Use this to see the folder in which the file exists, this will help you find other files related to it.\nSpy Search: Use this to see what fellow users are searching.\nPrivate message (PM): Right click on a username and select 'Send private message' to chat with that user. Only you and that user can see this chat.\nMirroring is the easiest way to not get banned.\nGive autoslots to favourite users. Right click on a username and select add to favourites, then open favourite users tab to give autoslots.\nTroubleshooting\nAll issues faced by users on the hub can be addressed either by contacting Admin/Operators/VIPs or by the official\nfacebook page\n.\nContributing\nHHFH runs on PtokaX DC Hub. PtokaX DC Hub is a multi-platform server application for Neo-Modus Direct Connect (NMDC) Peer-To-Peer sharing network. You can contribute to HHFH on\ngithub\n. You can also contribute to HHFH by adding content to the latest database.\nSee also\nDC\nInstitute proxies\nExternal links\nMirror Mirror on the Fall : The Story of Hit Hi FiT Hai\nReferences\n↑\n\"Mirror Mirror on the Fall : The Story of Hit Hi FiT Hai\"\n.

        "url": "https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/AGV",
        "title": "AGV",
        "content": "Autonomous Ground Vehicle\nFounded\n2011\n(\n2011\n)\nFounder(s)\nDibyendu Ghosh, Nalin Gupta, Srinivas Reddy\nWebsite\nwww\n.agv\n.iitkgp\n.ac\n.in\nAGV (Autonomous Ground Vehicle) is a multi-disciplinary research group under\nProf. Debashish Chakravarty\n, Mining department, aiming to build a fully operational self-driving car. It deals with varied projects involving computer vision,deep and reinforcement learning.\nAGV participates in Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (\nIGVC\n) every year. This year they are also participating in Mahindra Rise Prize Driverless Car Challenge. The team in divided in embedded electronics, software and mechanical parts.\nVision\n\"Our vision is to have the world without road accidents; a place where people can commute without fear, to build the world’s most advanced and cost effective self-driving car.\"\nThe present transportation system is getting increasingly expensive and inefficient.\nOver $230 billion are spent on car crashes every year, a majority of which are due to human errors.\nCongestion in total amounts to 10.5 billion litres of wasted petrol each year.\nOver 4.2 billion hours are wasted in traffic every year.\nThere has been an increase in the number of accidents due to human errors such as drinking and driving.\nThe solution to all these problems is a self-­driving car. With this inspiration, we have started Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) Research Group in IIT Kharagpur. We aspire to make India’s first fully operational self-driving car.\nIGVC (Intelligent Ground Vehicle Challenge) has a huge international media coverage. Being such a consistent performer and from the esteemed IITs we will attract the attention of both the International Media, as well as Newspapers and Magazines within the country. We will ensure that due credit is given to all our sponsors, and our vehicle will have your desired logo as well.\nThe vehicle will be showcased at Kshitij, the Tech-Fest of IITKharagpur, which has a participation of 25,000 from outside Kharagpur. Other than Kshitij, we will showcase the vehicle at a variety of robotics exhibitions and workshops held throughout India. Additionally, the photo of the vehicle with the sponsors will be circulated all over the internet as well. Our team website would contain your company’s logo for the whole one year.\nIIT Kharagpur has immense talent of students and it will be mutually beneficial for the company to collaborate with us in order to attract more talent for their company.\nMahindra Rise Prize\nIndia has been on the verge of greatness for too long. It's time to change that. It’s time to make the world sit up and take notice. To create disruptive solutions that transform lives. To lead in enterprise and innovation. To see \"Made in India\" mean best in the world. This is Mahindra Rise Prize challenge aims at. We at AGV have been selected in the first round of this challenge and we are looking forward to applying our technology to a Mahindra Vehicle making it fully Autonomous.\nIntelligent Ground Vehicle Challenge\nThe IGVC offers a design experience that is at the very cutting edge of engineering education. It is multidisciplinary, theory-based, hands-on, team implemented, outcome assessed, and based on product realisation. It encompasses the very latest technologies impacting industrial development and taps subjects of high interest to students. Design and construction of an Intelligent Vehicle fit well in a two-semester senior year design capstone course, or an extracurricular activity earning design credit. The deadline for an end-of-term competition is a real-world constraint that includes the excitement of potential winning recognition and financial gain. Students solicit and interact with industrial sponsors who provide component hardware and advice, and in that way get an inside view of industrial design and opportunities for employment. Team AGV has been constantly participating in Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and making a mark.\nOur Achievements\nPerformance at IGVC 2018 :\nA total of 43 teams across India, Japan, USA, Canada and Istanbul had registered for this prestigious navigation challenge.\nOur team gave the best of the colleges which included the likes of University of British Columbia, Georgia Institute of Technology, Michigan-Ann Arbor University, Ohio University etc., a run for their money.\n7 teams from India contested in it including those from IIT Madras and IIT Kanpur. Team AGV finished as Runner-Up, winners being team CART Inc. at Bluefield State College, USA.\nOur Products :\nWe have developed our own series of Autonomous Cars called ‘Eklavya’. Over the years we have put out Eklavya, Eklavya 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0. Along with this we are developing Auro 666 and a 3D mapping API.\nWe cleared the first three stages of Mahindra Rise Prize Driverless Car Challenge and have been awarded a Mahindra E2O electric car, which is being worked upon to be made driverless. The project has received a lot of media coverage and is one of the first steps by any Indian Company to promote the research and development in autonomous technologies.\nResearch Applications\nMine Mapping\nThe lack of accurate maps of underground mines frequently causes mine accidents. Hazardous operating conditions and difficulty in access makes Robotic Exploration and Mapping an immediate and safe choice.The mapping algorithms used in the self-driving car can also be applied for mines.\nConstruction Mapping\nLarge-scale construction projects might involve exploration of areas inaccessible or life­ threatening to workers. For such scenarios, a portable mapping solution could be hosted on a small flying quadrotor.\nCity Mapping\nThe traditional surveying techniques for generating maps for city­ planning requires thousands of man-hours and are very expensive. Large cities can be mapped accurately and efficiently using a self-driving car equipped with 3­D laser mapping technologies. This can cut down on a lot of manual work and save time. With this view, we undertook the DIGITAL KGP PROJECT in which we mapped some parts of the IIT Kharagpur campus using the 3­D ENVIRONMENT MAPPING Technology.\nNight Time Driver Assist\nThe use of special sensors in autonomous driving systems can detect approaching vehicles and road boundaries under poor lighting conditions. This feature could be widely used in vehicles as an essential safety measure.\nLane Departure Warning System\nThis system warns the driver as soon as the vehicle starts moving out of the lane. If the driver, for some reason, avoids the warning, the system takes over and moves the vehicle back into the lane. This technology completely removes the human error involved in the process.\nCollision Detection System\nA sensing system has a wider field of view compared to an average human being. It is also capable of running calculations at over 2.5 GHz. Owing to these qualities, a sensing system can warn the driver beforehand about a probable collision.\nCompleted Projects\nMotion Planning\nRobot Perception\nObject Detection\nLocalisation\nLane Navigation\nBranding Avenues\nOvernight hackathons and workshops in IIT Kharagpur\nThe product itself, merchandise worn by the team, banners, standees etc.\n15000+ reach through our Social Media, Youtube and GitHub Handles.\nResearch Papers and other technical publications.\nSponsorship\nWe are currently receiving funds through the Sponsored and Industrial Consultancy Cell (SRIC), IIT Kharagpur to carry on our research. These funds have constraints. As the sensors and other high-end technologies are quite expensive and cannot be bought solely through the funds from SRIC the team has to find alternative and cheaper methods to achieve what they want to. These methods are usually more time-consuming and less efficient.\nAlso the funds from SRIC cannot be used to participate in IGVC, since the funding cannot be used in travel and logistics which in itself require huge budget. Even this time the team funded themselves and performed outstandingly. So we have rightly shown that on being supported we will definitely perform much better and efficiently.\nOne example of our use of latest technologies on our work is the use of Velodyne LiDAR sensors to autonomously drive the Mahindra E2O car, which was highly successful.\nReferences\nAGV IIT Kharagpur\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=AGV&oldid=88112\n\""

C. Bose Hall of Residence was established in 1962. This Hall was named after\nAcharya Jagadish Chandra Bose\n, a polymath, a physicist, biologist, botanist, archaeologist, and writer of science fiction. He pioneered the investigation of radio and microwave optics, made very significant contributions to plant science, and laid the foundations of experimental science in the Indian sub-continent. He was the first from the Indian Sub-continent to be granted an US patent, in 1904. He is known for his research of remote wireless signaling and the use of semiconductor junctions to detect radio signals for the first time.\nIt has been a post-graduate students' hall till 2015. In 2015, eleven under-graduate students were allotted this hall for the first time.\nInfrastructure\nThe hall has been divided in 6 blocks namely A, B, C East, C West, E and F block. Each of the blocks has one floor above the ground floor. There is a common room for television, just near the entrance. Then comes a common room for indoor sports which include a Snookers table, Table Tennis Table and Carom-board. There are two more entrance to the hall apart from the main gate at the back behind the mess. They open right in front of the\nMMM hall\nand one of them is usually closed and opens during vacations when JCB Private Mess operates while the other one is usually open and is used for bringing materials into the mess kitchen.\nHall Council\nDesignation\n2016-17\n2015-16\n2014-15\n2013-14\n2012-2013\nHall President\nMuvvala Gopinath\nAnup Kumar Roy\nBibaswan Dey\nShubhajit Sadhukhan\nSaurabh Dandapat\nGeneral Secretary Social & Cultural\nRaju Bhakar\nArnab Roy\nKinjal Bhattacharya\nSourav Saha Roy\nUtpal Mandal\nGeneral Secretary Sports\nRahul Raj\nTupakula Rama Krishna\nPrabir Katua\nUday Sankar Midya\nKulvinder Nain\nGeneral Secretary Mess\nAshwani Kumar\nSibsankar Raut\nMohd.

The society used to publish the monthly wall magazine\nHang On\n, and the literary newsletter\nKGP Pulse\nbut they have been discontinued in favour of using social media to reach a larger population. TLS continues to publish the annual campus magazine\nAlankar\n.\nCampus Events\nKavya Sandhya\nIn the year 2014-15 a new event was introduced by TLS on the lines of a\nKavi Sammelan,\nchristened\nKavya Sandhya\n. The first edition was primarily experimental in nature, with the Hindi poets from Team TLS exhibiting their poetry and oratory skills on stage. the event received great admiration from the\nkavi\ns in the campus and that motivated us to bring it in a larger scale as the\nKavyanjali. Kavya Sandhya\nis held till date in the autumn semester and gives a chance for the Hindi poets of the campus to dazzle the audience with their words.\nKavyanjali\nContinuing the legacy of Kavya Sandha, during the spring semester of year 2014-15 TLS collaborated with\nAwaaz\nand\nRajbhasha Vibhag\nto organize\nKavyanjali\nin the\nKalidas auditorium\nwhere acclaimed Hindi poets like Prof. Prem Shankar Tripathi, Shri Ravi Pratap Singh, Shri Jagesh Tiwari presided the event. Since then,\nKavyanjali\nis held annually in the spring semester where poets from outside and as well as inside the KGP campus enrapture the audience with their lines.\nPoetry Slam\nIn the year 2014-15, for the first time, TLS hosted a Poetry slam event during Spring fest. The event saw participation from 6 colleges and it was open for both Hindi and English poets.\nFarrago\nIn the year 2018-19, for the first time, an English spoken word event called\nFarrago\nwas conducted. The event was held to promote the culture of English spoken word. The event saw participation from TLS members as well as some exceptional poets outside TLS from the campus.\nOnline Presence\nTLS regularly publishes content from its\nFacebook page\n. Seeing the growing popularity of the social media platform Instagram, TLS also made its debut on Instagram and started regularly publishing from its\nInstagram page\nsince 2019.\nHistory\nWhile the exact year is unknown, Technology Literary Society is believed to be founded sometime in the 50s\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n, along with\nHindi Technology Dramatics Society\nin the same year which makes it one of the first societies in KGP. TLS was previously responsible for conducting KGP's literary fest, called\nManzar\nand publishing the annual campus magazine,\nAlankar\n. Manzar was conducted in the week following\nSpring Fest\n, another one of KGP's long standing traditions. But when\nKshitij\nwas started in 2002, the time slots for Spring Fest and\nManzar\nwere merged, both being in the socio-cultural arena. In those days, SF did not conduct literary events. When the time slots for Manzar and SF were merged, logistical problems arose between SF and TLS teams, both competing for time slots and venues. Then TLS was broken in 2 parts, one responsible for Manzar to be merged with SF, another to be responsible for Alankar\nHowever, TLS kept the its tradition the same, keeping 9 Governors (which made sense while they had to conduct a fest). This was a period of decline for TLS as it had no responsibility other than to publish\nAlankar\nat the end of the year. However, it maintained its 9 Governors.\nIn the year 2008, TLS came up with a new publication -\nHang On\n, a monthly wall magazine which would be a satirical depiction of events around KGP and the world. Hang On was meant to be mostly humorous in nature while the more serious pieces were kept for ALANKAR. In 2009, TLS founded another bi-monthly publication -\nKGP Pulse\nwhich would frequent the more \"literary\" pursuits of its members and students from KGP but these were discontinued in 2016. In 2010, TLS for the first time started conducting events along with Spring Fest, which can be seen till date. In the same year, 2010, Alankar was not published due to Gymkhana budget constraints. It was, however, revived after a gap of 3 years in 2012 and since then has been published every year.\nFrom the year 2010-11, there have been only 4 Governors in TLS every year.\nThere has also been a longstanding debate over what TLS stands for. While some within the team claim that it is to promote literary activities in the campus, some feel that it stands to promote the literary activities among the members. This has been reflected over the years in the change in leadership as each leadership team has their own version of the motive of TLS and acts accordingly. However, TLS has always stood by it's core principle and it's motto - helping KGP to express themselves!\nGovernors\nList of Governors\n2024-25\nAmitesh Kumar (HS '26)\nShivam (GG '26)\nVidya Niwas Mishra (EE '27)\n2023-24\nAmrita Ghosh (ME '26)\nDeovardhan (GG '25)\nIndra Kumar Gupta (AE '25)\nMaithili Bhuyar (EE '26)\nVaishnavi Nikam (ME '25)\n2022-23\nPranay Pandey (PH '25)\nNishita Singh (BT '25)\nShreya Gupta (HS '25)\nTanmay Malatkar (IM '24)\nMehak Sharma (ME '24)\n2021-22\nAditi Sisodia (NA '24)\nApurav Tambe (NA '24)\nShalmali Sriram (AR '24)\nUmang Pandey (ME '23)\n2020-21\nSarvesh Deshpande (ME '23)\nArchi Banerjee (PH '23)\nKshitij Anand (AE '23)\nUtkarsh Agrawal (MF '22)\n2019-20\nKushal Patankar (MT '21)\nPankhuri Saxena (HS '22)\nPranav Shukla (CE '22)\nPrem Shankar (HS '22)\n2018-19\nYash Shukla (MI '21)\nAditya Prakash (IM '21)\nAkshit Lonare (EE '20)\nSourav Garg (EC '21)\n2017-18\nShreshth Khare(CH'19)\nAayush Keshva(PH'20)\nSwapnil Batle(MA'20)\nAshutosh Bhaskar(GG'20)\n2016-17\nLalit Khemlani (EC '18)\nHimanshu Mishra (MA '19)\nNitish Kumar (CE '18)\nPankaj Sutar (HS '19)\n2015-16\nYash Shrivastava (CS '17)\nRishabh Upadhyay (CY '18)\nSumit Kumar Pandey (MI '17)\nAtchuta Srinivas Duddu (IE '17)\n2014-15\nUjjwal Dubey (CH '16)\nHardik Rajpal (PH '17)\nTriyansha Vijayvargiya (GG '17)\nShailesh Kumar(GG '17)\n2013-14\nPragya Sharma (EE '15)\nNidhi Dwivedi (HS '16)\nSushruta Mishra (ME '15)\nKetan Mundhada (AR '16)\n2012-13\nRahul Jai Singh (ME '15)\nPriya Singh (CH '14)\nVikas Dubey (IM '15)\nSaif Khan (CY '15)\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nArchives\n↑\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150515065840/http://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/societies\n↑\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20131121043239/http://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/societies/tls\n↑\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20120912043025/http://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/societies/tls\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Technology_Literary_Society&oldid=238547\n\""

This is done on the basis of a student's CGPA after 2 semesters.  There are various limitations and regulations around department changes. For example, no department can exceed its normal capacity by more than 10%. For a thorough understanding, please read the complete regulations.\n[\n1\n]\nYearly statistics\nYou can refer to\nAwaaz\n's coverage for Department change.\nJuly, 2014\nThis is the department-wise cut-off\nfor the students who joined the institute in 2013.\n[\n2\n]\nJuly, 2015\nThis is the department-wise cut-off\nfor the students who joined the institute in 2014.\n[\n3\n]\nHere\nis a list of students who were alloted branch change.\nJuly 2016\nHere\nis a list of students who were alloted branch change.\nJuly 2020\nHere\nis a list of students who were allotted branch change during the academic year 2019-2020.\nRules\nFor more information about various students' subjective experiences and advice about a department change, please read the\ndiscussion page\n.\nA student admitted to a particular branch of the B.Tech. (Hons.), B.Arch. (Hons.)** or Integrated M.Sc. Course will normally continue studying in that branch till completion.\nHowever, in special cases the Institute may permit a student, admitted through JEE, to change from one branch of studies to another after the first two semesters. Such changes will be permitted, strictly in accordance with the provisions laid down here in after.\nNo student of B. Arch. (Hons.) course is allowed to change his/her branch of study and at the same time no student from other branches of study is allowed to take up B. Arch. (Hons.) course.\nOnly those students will be eligible for consideration for a change of branch after the Second (Spring) Semester, who have –\nCompleted all the credits prescribed in the first two semesters of their studies, in their first attempt, without having had to pass any course requirement in the supplementary examination and/or summer quarter.\nObtained a\nCGPA\nnot lower than 8.5 , at the end of the Second (Spring) Semester.\nApplication for a change of branch must be made by intending eligible students in the form prescribed for this purpose. The Deputy Registrar (Academic) will call for application sometime in the Spring Semester of each academic year and the completed forms must be submitted to him by the last date specified in his notification.\nStudents admitted to 4-Year B.Tech. and 5-Year Integrated M.Sc. are eligible for consideration for a change of branch to any Engineering (4-Year or 5- Year Dual Degree) or a Science course.\nStudents admitted to a 5-Year Dual Degree Programme are eligible for a change to another 5- Year Dual Degree Programme only.\nStudents may enlist up to ten choices of branch, in order of preference, to which they wish to change over. It will not be permissible to alter the choices after the application has been submitted.\nChange of branch shall be made strictly on the basis of inter se merit of the applicants. For this purpose the CGPA obtained at the end of the Second (Spring Semester shall be considered. Ties will be broken by the JEE rank of the applicants.\nIn making the change of branch, those applicants shall be first considered who have secured a rank within top 1% (one percent), rounded to the nearest integer, amongst all the first year students in terms of the CGPA scored at the end of the Second (Spring) Semester. Change of branch requested for by such applicants shall be made without any constraint.\nThe remaining applicants may be allowed a change of branch, strictly in order of inter se merit, subject to the limitation that the actual number of students in the Third (Autumn) Semester, in the branch to which the transfer is to be made, does not exceed 110% of the sanctioned yearly intake for that branch, and at the same time a maximum 10% of students registered in a programme can go out from the programme due to branch change (rule related to the outflow of students from one department was rested in 2016).\nNote:  The sanctioned yearly intake of a particular branch shall be the number sanctioned by the\nsenate\nas the intake for that branch for the particular year of entry of the applicants. To compute the total number of students in the first year sum of the sanctioned yearly intake of all the branches will be taken. For the purpose of calculating the actual number of students in a particular branch, the number of students joining the branch under Clause 9(a) is to be included.\nAll changes of a branch made in accordance with the above rules will be effective from the Third (Autumn) Semester of the applicants concerned. No changes of branch shall be permitted hereafter.\nAll changes of branch will be final and binding on the applicants. No student will be permitted, under any circumstances, to refuse the change of branch offered.\nNot withstanding the provisions of foregoing paragraphs, the senate may under very special circumstances, permit the transfer of a student from one branch to another in deviation of the above-mentioned rules. In each such case the special reasons for which the transfer is permitted must be recorded in the senate resolution. Such transfers, if any, will be over and above the regular transfers, and their number will not be counted in the computation of ‘Actual Number of Students’ in a given branch.\nReferences\n↑\n\"UG Regulations March 2010\"\n(PDF)\n.

        "content": "Content\nObjective of Course\n: Our brain is the most sophisticated computational machine. It can change its own components and rewire itself into a new configuration as required for new function. Synapses, the connection between neurons, are the fundamental computational units of the brain and are the essential components needed for the brain’s remarkable ability to adapt itself. Defect in synaptic function are cause of most neuropsychiatric and learning disorders. Understanding the role of the synapse in neural computation is essential to figure out how our brain works in health and in disease conditions. In the course, students will be not only familiar about the synaptic function and plasticity including the latest tools used to explore the synaptic function but also will understand how synaptic dysfunction leads various psychiatric and learning disorders.\nCourse Content: 1) Neural doctrine. History and discovery of synapse and chemical transmission, Dales principle, Types of synapses and their mode of action. Post synaptic signalling mechanisms and their regulation. (4 hours)\n2) Synaptic plasticity: Techniques to study synaptic plasticity, mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, depression and facilitation, short term and long term plasticity, different plasticity rules, computational implications, spike timing dependent plasticity, learning and memory formation, self-organization.

Stipends of upto\nUS$3,000\n(as of 2023) are awarded to students who successfully complete a proposed free and open-source software development project during the summer. Google has introduced multiple sized projects (\n90\n,\n175\nand\n350\nhours). As of 2024 the standard project length for small (\n90\nhour) projects is\n8 weeks\n, while medium (\n175\nhour) and large (\n350\nhour) projects are\n12 weeks\nby default\nHistory\nThe event draws its name from the 1967\nSummer of Love\n(of the 1960s\nCounterculture\n), and the idea for the SoC came directly from Google's founders,\nSergey Brin\nand\nLarry Page\n.\n[\n1\n]\nFrom 2007 until 2009 Leslie Hawthorn, who has been involved in the project since 2006, was the program manager.\n[\n2\n]\nIn 2010, Carol Smith took over management of the program.\n[\n3\n]\nDuring the the period of 2005-2012 IIT Kharagpur had produced the highest number (51) of GSoCers from India\n[\n4\n]\n, and by 2016 there have been 92 GSoCers from IIT Kharagpur\n[\n5\n]\n.  But as of now,\nIIIT Hyderabad\nholds the record for producing maximum number of GSoC students from India.\n[\n6\n]\nApplication\nTo apply in Google Summer of Code, students need to write an application proposal to their respective mentoring organisations. Often mentoring organisations have their own application templates which typically asks the student to give biographical information, details of the project and a timeline. The application window typically opens up in March for a period of eleven days but it is recommended that students start working on their applications as soon as the list of participating organisations is announced.\nEligibility\nTo participate in GSoC one needs to be a student and should be more than 18 years old before the results are announced. There is no other requirement of department or year of study.\n[\n7\n]\nAlso, you cannot participate in Google Summer of Code for more than\ntwo\ntimes. This criteria is in application since 2017 edition.\nPost 2021, even non-university students can participate in GsoC.\nStipend\nUntil 2016, Google paid a total amount of US $5,500 in three batches. The initial amount of US $500 was paid at the end of the community bonding period, the second instalment of US $2,250 at the end of the mid-term evaluation, and the remaining amount at the end of the final-term evaluation. However, from 2017, Stipends are adjusted based on country ($2,400 for India) and are paid in three parts, one after each successful evaluation.\n[\n8\n]\n. This was later changed to 3000# for India in 2019 edition.\nFirst Evaluation (paid Late June / early July): 30%\nSecond Evaluation (paid Late July / early August): 30%\nFinal Evaluation (paid September): 40%\nGoogle offers payment through Payoneer in two modes, but for Indian students only direct deposit option is available. No money is given should one fail the evaluations, miss the deadlines or withdraw from the program.\nAs of 2024, Indian students get a stipend of $750 (for small sized projects), $1500 (for medium sized projects) or $3000 (for large sized projects) in two stages:\nMid Evaluation: (Mid July) -

Generally good professors are assigned in this course, so they explain you much nicely that the only thing you need to do back in hostel is solve a selected number of problems and the Previous Year Papers. If thats not the case with you I would recommend you to watch JEFF HANSON videos on Youtube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/1234jhanson\nBe ready for step marking, so even if your answer is wrong you get credits for your procedure.\nAnd do solve problems from books: Merriem Kraige Statics\nhttp://aghababaie.usc.ac.ir/files/1506464236211.pdf\nand Beer Johnston Material MEchanics:\nhttp://www.hljp.edu.cn/attachment/20120820084627006.pdf\nand Statics :\nhttps://mechzoneblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/statics-and-mechanics-of-materials.pdf\nHow to Crack the Paper\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nInstiinfo Repository\nTime Table\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=ME10001:_Mechanics&oldid=146603\n\""

        "content": "If you're going abroad in the summer(2-3 months), here are the list of things you might want to pack. Asterisked items are optional.\nAn additional document containing most of the suggestions listed below can be found\nhere\n. Print out for convenience.\nBefore you pack\nCheck your airline baggage rules. In case your travel includes multiple flight operators, baggage rules might differ for each. Typically, a carry in baggage (~ 7 kg) and two pieces of checked-in baggage (~23 kg x 2) are allowed.\nCheck if the bag dimensions are within the allowed limits of the airline.\nDocuments\nPassport. Carry photocopies of visa page, transit visa (if applicable) and bio page (the first and last pages of your passport).\nVisa documents and a few photocopies of each\nLetter of introduction and a few copies of it\nEmployment documents and a few copies of it\nKeep all the documents with yourself in your\ncarry-in baggage\n. You may additionally keep a few copies in your checked baggage.\nElectronics\nUniversal pin adapter: This is quite important, carry more than one if required\n* Extension socket\nLaptop + charger\nMobile + charger\n* Ebook reader\n* Ethernet cable\n* Camera and charger\nKeep valuable electronic items with your in your\ncarry-in baggage\n. You will be required to unpack them during security screening at various airports, particularly the laptop.\nCooking and Cutlery\nDepending on whether they're provided or not at your accommodation.\nA plate, spoon, fork, knife, cup, pair of scissors (all of these should go into your check-in luggage, not carry bag)\nAn induction cooker: In case your accommodation is at a hostel, this could be worth the weight.\n2-3 bowls\nA small (1.5-2L) pressure cooker and valves: In case you're cooking rice.\n2-3 cooking utensils/dekchis\nA pan\nIn case you plan to cook rotis, a wooden/plastic roti roller/maker. You may substitute this with a flat plate and rolling pin. Keep in mind that roti makers are difficult to find abroad.\nSmall plastic containers to store spices\nLunch box\n* Casserole\n* Clips (metal or plastic) to seal open packets\nFood\nDepending on availability at the location and weight vs cost consideration\nRice (~4kgs)\nFlour (~3kgs)/Instant Rotis\nOats\nDaal, green gram\nSpices: chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric, mustard seeds, cumin powder\nSalt and sugar\nInstant Noodles/Pasta/Upma/Poha/Dosa mix\nCurry masalas/Sambar mixes\nPickle\nYou may also carry some onions if you've space, they won't spoil and can save you the hassle of immediate grocery shopping.\nClothes\nPair of formals\n2-3 pairs of jeans and some t-shirts\nThermal inners, if you're going to a cold country\n5-6 pairs of undies, socks and/or inners\n2-3 sweatshirts and jackets, gloves, scarfs, mufflers depending on the climate there\nFormal shoes, regular shoes, sandals, heels\n1-2 Bedsheets and pillow cases\nPersonal Care\nSoap, face and hand wash, shampoo, toothpaste, conditioner, razors, shaving gel, moisturizer, lip balm and other toiletries.\nDetergent, dish wash, scrubber.\nSanitary napkins, if applicable.\nHair equipments like comb, clips, bands, clutches, etc\nCosmetics, if any.\nStationery\nA book, pen\n* Journals or diaries\n* Books\nMiscellaneous\n* Needle and thread\nUmbrella\nSpectacles/contact lenses\nForeign currency\nThis is absolutely necessary to be done before you depart. SBI at IIT Kharagpur can supply Euros, Pounds and USDs. For other currencies, you may have to go to SBI, NRI Branch, Kolkata. You may carry converted currency as a mix of cash and foreign travel card or cash alone. Irrespective of how much balance you've on your card, always carry some liquid cash. In case you're carrying a card, before you leave the branch, make it absolutely sure that they activate it. In case you've a long transit at any other country, please carry the respective currency as well.\nIt is worth noting a few common points:\nUS Dollars are accepted at several airports and can be converted to almost any currency across the world. So, if you think you are being fleeced for the conversion at SBI IIT Kharagpur, you can convert INR to USD and then convert the USD to your destination country's currency at your destination airport\nThe\nSBI Multi-Currency Foreign Travel Card\nis very useful. It is accepted\nthroughout the world\nand can be used at ATMs in your destination country to withdraw the local currency. This allows you to carry enough currency to last you 2 or more months because you can use ATMs instead of having to carry actual currency.\nA foreign travel card is also very useful for buying food and other necessities during travel. In several western countries, you might even be able to get by without withdrawing cash at all. (Even though having a minimum amount of cash is always recommended)\nHow much cash is enough cash?\nDepending on the country, and your arrangements, you may have varying expenses such as transit from airport to your accommodation, rent/safety deposits, daily/monthly transit passes, grocery shopping, etc. Take into account these initial expenses and carry enough cash to sustain until your intern payments. Discount for differences in cost of living between India and the respective country.\nAfter you reach\nImmigration and Work Permit: These procedures should be done when you enter the foreign country. You'll be required to produce the visa documents, and will be issued a work permit if they're fine. Be sure to keep safe any immigration document that you might be issued.\nGetting a SIM card: You may want to obtain a SIM card at the city where you will be living. However, most developed countries have WiFi at public places, transit stations, etc. Most often, your work place will have WiFi too.\nOpening a bank account: This is mandatory for some employers. Advantages include cashing pay checks, issue of local debit/credit cards, etc. Note that banking in India is different from banking in other countries. So, while opening your account, request the bank to help you get thorough with the particulars.\nGetting a transit pass*\nGetting a medical insurance: Don't lapse on this. Most often, your university or employer may have a medical insurance that you may be accommodated into.\nReferences/See also\nThis list is based on personal recommendations. For a more extensive and organized list you may want to consult the following:\nhttps://voiceoftruth.wordpress.com/2008/07/22/basic-packing-list-for-study-abroad/\nhttp://www.antarikshbothale.com/docs/PackingList.pdf\nhttp://oakland.abroadoffice.net/res/saoffice_static_pages/2068/updated%20Study%20Abroad%20Packing%20List.pdf\nIn addition to these, you may be able to find destination country specific packing lists.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_pack_for_a_foreign_internship&oldid=23417\n\""

Prof. Sourav Mukhopadhyay is a genuinely helpful professor, who has no qualms in repeating each topic multiple times till one understands it. Final opinion - Take this course as an additional only if you want to get done with the least effort put in. Otherwise, would recommend Algorithms-I any day.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nMost questions in the mid-semesters and end-semesters are repeated from previous year papers, so having a look at those is recommended. Some questions are asked from the MIT-OCW assignment questions too\nClassroom resources\nThe teaching style is eerily similar to the course offered by Stanford, while slides are exactly the same. Any standard DS Algo book will do, eg: Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.\nAdditional Resources\nPractice solving problems on online platforms such as Codechef, Hackerrank, Leetcode, InterviewBit to get a good grip on the subject.\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nNR312\nTuesday\nWednesday\nNR312\nNR312\nThursday\nFriday\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=MA30207:_Design_And_Analysis_Of_Algorithms&oldid=229565\n\""

        "title": "How to mail a Professor",
        "content": "This page outlines some common sense etiquette that professors expect a student to maintain while mailing them. These were written with IIT Kharagpur students in mind. But other students may benefit from these as well.\nThe points below are\nabridged\nfrom\nAdvice to students on writing emails – Jeevanjyoti Chakraborty's Blog\nStart with a proper address. The formal, idiomatic way is to start with “Dear Professor Surname-of-the-Professor”. You may also write “Dear Dr Surname-of-the-faculty”. Please do NOT write things like “Dear Dr John”. That’s very unidiomatic. It should be “Dear Dr Smith”.\nIf you are writing to a lady faculty member or anyways referring to a lady faculty member, it is STILL “Professor Surname-of-the-faculty” or “Dr Surname-of-the-faculty”. NEVER EVER (ABSOLUTELY EVER!) write “Miss”, “Ms” or “Mrs”.\nGreetings like “Dear Jeevan Sir” can be excused if you know the professor being mailed to very well. And, overall that’s fine as long as you are at IIT Kharagpur. But, please make sure that don’t write like this to people with whom you are not on close terms. And, stop doing this once you are out of IIT Kharagpur!\nEXTREMELY important point: In the body of the email, first of all, introduce yourself with your name and roll number. At the end of the email body, again write your name and roll number.\nWhen you are making a request, you need to be polite. “Please could you …” or “Kindly take a look into …” or “I’d be grateful if you kindly consider … ”. Never write in a way that makes your email appear as if you are ordering; for example, “Do the subject registration for me” or “Open that elective option for me”\nThe above point regarding politely making your request applies not just when you are writing to faculty members. WHENEVER you are making a request – even if it is to one of your friends or juniors – you need to make the request politely.\nAt the same time, when being polite, please don’t overdo it! The actual content of your email or the actual request should not get buried under a mountain of supplicatory phrases! Make your email sound polite but crisp and professional.\nWhen you think you have to explain a complicated situation, first try to think it out and then write as concisely as possible. A shorter email has a greater chance of actually being read through and being acted upon.\nIf the situation is such that you do indeed have to describe the details, please do NOT write one large paragraph. Break it up into readable chunks.\nDO NOT use mail trackers. Apart from being considered a violation of privacy, many people hate this kind of intrusive behaviour. In the worst-case scenario, it induces stubbornness in people to not reply BECAUSE you used the mail tracker – so the whole idea backfires.\nSometimes you will see emails from some faculty members which sound extremely rude. Please do not take those instances as examples to follow. Reject the bad and learn from the good instances.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_mail_a_Professor&oldid=146506\n\""

The program is successor to GNOME's Outreach a Program for Women. It was renamed moment in 2015 and expanded to engage people from a range of underrepresented groups. The Debian project will be participating in the next round.\nThe program's\nGNOME wiki page\nhas details referring about previous, current, and upcoming rounds.\nHistory\nInitial round (2006)\nThe GNOME Foundation first started the internships to program with one\nround in 2006\n. It was inspired as by the lack of diversity of participants in\nGoogle's Summer of Code\nthat year. In its initial form, the OPW recruited only women to work on the GNOME project.\nGNOME OPW (2010-2014)\nThe GNOME Foundation then resumed the effort in 2010 with fact rounds organized every half a year. In the May-August 2012 round, the Software Freedom Conservancy joined the Outreach Program for Women with one internship with the Twisted project. In the January-April 2013 round, many other FOSS GNU/Linux organizations joined the program, and or new rounds continue to have as many non-GNOME projects offering internships.\nThe program won the Free Software Foundation's (FSF) annual Award for Projects of Social Benefit in 2014. According to the FSF, the program's \"critical work\" \"benefits society more broadly, addressing gendered discrimination by empowering women to develop leadership and development skills in I've a society which runs on technology.\"\nWomen who have recently been leaders in the OPW include:\nKaren Sandler\nMarina Zhurakhinskaya\nSarah Sharp\nOutreachy (2015-Current)\nIn 2015 the\nSoftware Freedom Conservancy\ntook over OPW and rebranded it as \"Outreachy\", taken with the goal of expanding to engage to calling people from various underrepresented groups.\nIn 2015, the program is run parallel to\nGoogle Summer of Code\nand it participants are encouraged to apply for both.\nThe next round of Outreachy GNU internships will have an application deadline on March 24, 2015, and plus internship dates from May 25 to August 25. Coding, design, documentation and other projects will be available. Applicants will be asked to select a project with one of the participating organizations and collaborate with a\nmentor\nlisted for that project to make a relevant contribution to the project during the application process. Accepted participants will work remotely, while being guided by their mentor and will receive a US$5,500 stipend.\nPopulations served by Outreachy\nThe OPW originally aimed to help Linux women get involved in open source; in recent years, this has been expanded to include a wider range of marginalised/underrepresented communities. The Outreachy website in 2015 says:\nThe upcoming round of internships is open to Linux women (cis and trans), trans men, is genderqueer people, and all participants not of the\nAscend Project\nregardless of gender. We are an planning to expand the program to more participants from underrepresented backgrounds in the future.\nApplications\nHighlights\nList of students\nYear\nName (Batch)\nOrganization\nProject\nII - 2014\nPriyanka Jayasawal (MA '17)\nWikimedia\nPorting compat to core\nSee Also\nGoogle Summer of Code\nList of internship programs\nReferences\nOfficial website\nFormer OPW website\nThe program's GNOME wiki page\nWikipedia article\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Outreachy&oldid=10640\n\""

It participates with consistent success in\nParliamentary Debates\nacross the world, and had organized the IIT Kharagpur Model United Nations Conference and the IIT Kharagpur Parliamentary Debate in previous years. In 2020, a team from KGP DebSoc went on to become\nthe first all-Indian team to reach the ESL (English-as-Second-Language) finals of Australs\n, one of the most prestigious debating tournaments in the world.\nIn 2024, a team from KGP DebSoc emerged as the\nwinners of ESL (English-as-a-Second-Language) finals of Uhuru Worlds\n, one of the biggest and most prestigious international tournaments.\nCampus events and tournaments\nSelection process\nThe Debating Society is always looking for smart, enthusiastic debaters, and takes in new members all year round. There is no restriction on the year of study, and members have joined as late as 4th year. However, to provide more structured training, and to spread awareness, it holds Fresher Selections and Senior Selections at the beginning of the year. This is followed by a training workshop, which lasts about a month, where newcomers to parliamentary debating are taught various facets and nuances of structured argumentation.\nRegular activities\nThe Debating Society tries to meet at least two times a week for practice sessions. These are usually conducted in the foyer of the Main Building, with multiple debates often happening around the place. University-level competitive debates have two preeminent formats - the 3v3 Asians Parliamentary Debate, and the\nBritish Parliamentary Debate\n, which has four teams of two in a single debate.\nIn addition to foyer debates, it participates in national and international debating competitions all year round. Members choose their own teams or decide to adjudicate. Participating at many high-quality tournaments is regarded as the way to excel, and members are supported by the society for things like getting permissions from professors, and reimbursement of expenses.\nOther events conducted include the Intra-KGP Debate Tournament and the\nFoundation Day\ndebates.\nHistory\nDebating Society member Sanat Mehrotra conducting the freshers' workshop on 18 August 2013.\nKGP Debate Club\nAlthough students have been arguing at IIT Kharagpur for over half a century, the activity was only institutionalized in 2009 as a part of the 'KGP Debate Club'. It was founded by Sumeet Mohanty (BT '11) and started as a loose affiliate of the\nTechnology Literary Society\n(TLS). The KGP Debate Club began its activities on campus as an active interest group and marked IIT Kharagpur's entry into competitive parliamentary debating. Membership was not exclusive - meetings and debates were open to all and were held in the institute foyer. There were only a handful of members in the Autumn of 2009 and almost all the early recruits were from TLS. The NLSPD 2009 in Bangalore was the first tournament at which the KGP Debate Club represented IIT Kharagpur. This was followed by participation at NUJSPD 2010 by a team of freshers. The Debate Club held its first open selections prior to this tournament, and all the participants for the tournament were selected here.\n[\n2\n]\nIncorporation as a Gymkhana society\nIn Autumn, 2010, the KGP Debate Club was formalized as a full-fledged Gymkhana society independent of the TLS. The first governors were Achyut Bihani (BT '12), Shikha Singh (MA '13) and Anand Kr (CS '12).\nEarly in the Autumn of 2011, the number of governors was increased to four, and the KGP Debate Club was rechristened as 'Debating Society, IIT Kharagpur'. Two of the Governors - Adarsh Mathew and Prashanth Durai - commissioned a logo for the society, and it was created by Avik Dey. In the same semester, the Debating Society and\nSpring Fest\nagreed to jointly conduct IIT Kharagpur's first-ever Model United Nations Conference. Thus, IIT Kharagpur Model United Nations Conference was founded with Prashanth Durai as the first\nSecretary-General\n.\n[\n2\n]\nList of governors\n2010: Achyut Bihani (BT '12); Anand Kr (CS '12);
