The project carries at least 1/3rd weightage and usually, there is a lab test on Java Programming based on the Java concepts taught (simple but lengthy lab test). Attendance carries marks.\nStudent Opinion\nHow to Crack the Paper\nIn the Java programming test, make sure to write comments in your code. You may go for an editor like VSCode which does the basic getter and setter commenting by itself. These comments carry 10-20% weightage of the class test. Make sure you are able to code basic java programming with speed, without referring to internet. Students are genrraly allwoed to access internet during the test. Make sure the UI is neatly designed, it carries a lot of weightage. Having more features, though simple is a big plus. Attend all the labs. Attendance carries marks about 20 percent.\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=CS29006:_Software_Engineering_Laboratory&oldid=88143\n\""

These activities include Hall maintenance, welfare activities, grand dinners, festival functions, alumni meets, etc.\nGKH Hall is a little different from other halls because it only accommodates freshers. Before 2022, it was boarded by PhD scholars and the first freshers batch was in the academic session 2022-23.\nThe Hall Council Members of the academic session 2022-23 and 2023-24 are as follows -\nDesignation\n2022-23\n2023-24\nHall President\nVaibhav\nBhavy Vaishnav\nSecond Senate Member\nSwastik Kumar Das\nRohan Singh\nGeneral Secretary - Social & Cultural\nAtul Choudhary\nSheersh Nigam\nGeneral Secretary - Sports & Games\nSushant Pandey\nAzhar Ul Shamus\nGeneral Secretary - Technology\n-\nLokesh Ingale\nGeneral Secretary - Maintenance\nNavneet Sinwar\nAnushesh Jumale\nGeneral Secretary - Alumni Affairs\n-\nNikhil Mourya\nGeneral Secretary - Students' Welfare\nSambhav Jain\nSarthak Yadav\nGeneral Secretary - Mess\nRohan Kulshreshtha\nHimanshu Iwanati\nUnder Secretary - Maintenance\n-\nSwayam Chavan\nUnder Secretary - Mess\n-\nTejas Sushil Rajput\nInfrastructure\nThe hall has been divided in 3 blocks namely A, B, and C. Each of the blocks has 2 floors above the ground floor. There is a common room for television, just near the entrance. There is also a common room for indoor sports which include a Table Tennis Table and Carom-board.\nAccomodation\nIn the academic year 2023-24, Gokhale Hall accommodates around 150 students. According to the HMC's website, this hall has 10 single-accommodation rooms and 44 triple-sharing rooms.\n[\n1\n]\nThe triple-sharing rooms are quite cramped and not very well ventilated (it appears that they were originally built to accommodate two people), but have attached toilets and rooms to wash clothes by hands. Each floor also has two common toilets and a washing-machine, as well as water coolers.\nReferences\n↑\nhttps://hmc.iitkgp.ac.in/web/halls/\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Gokhale_Hall_of_Residence&oldid=238377\n\""

It provides a platform for like-minded individuals who yearn to enrich their knowledge of business and apply their skills in various competitions like case studies and hackathons at the national and international levels. A family of around 70 student members, actively working under 3 wings:\nStrategy, Finance, and Analytics\n, BClub is constantly striving to bridge the gap between business and technology.\nHistory\nFounding\nBusiness Club was founded in 2009 as\nGenese-de-Strategie\nby Shailesh Gupta, Harsh Gupta, Srichandana Sanjeev, Sudipto Sannigrahi, and Mayank Mundra. Genesie-de-Strategie was started with a primary objective to educate the students about the world of business strategies. The founders felt a need for students to be informed about the working of the business world for their growth. Over the course of a year, they realised the need to have a more wholesome approach to the world of business. They formed the Business Club in 2010 with a broader perspective toward business.\nGrowth\nIndian Case Challenge,\nIndia’s largest case competition, is the flagship event of the Business Club. ICC now witnesses international participation as well.\nAffiliation to Technology Students’ Gymkhana\n(during the academic session 2014-15) brought official recognition to the club.\nThe Business Club has started to reach out to the entire student population of the college by conducting\nOpen House Sessions\nfor their benefit.\nRegular\nsocial media content\nand\nblogs\nin the domain of finance, strategy and analytics are uploaded on all major social media platforms to keep readers updated.\nFunctioning\nSelections\nSelections to the Business Club are held at the beginning of the first and the second academic year.\nFirst-year selections\nThe selection procedure consists of a\ngroup-discussion\nround followed by a personal\ninterview\nfor the shortlisted candidates. Prospective members aren’t judged based on their business acumen, but on their ability to think clearly, present thoughts in a concise and structured manner, their dedication, and their zeal to learn.\nSecond-year selections\nA training period called the\nsummer program\nis conducted for the students selected in the second academic year to level their knowledge with the students selected in the first year. During this time, they are provided with the same resources to learn everything necessary.\nAfter the summer program, every associate is evaluated on the same knowledge level and a final personal interview is conducted to select the students with the highest knowledge in the three domains. Other soft skills like communication are also kept in mind. Selected students are then assigned the position of sub-heads.\nStructure\nBusiness Club has a four-level organisational structure.\nAdvisors\nconsist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the club.\nThe executive body comprises of\nGovernors\nand\nHeads\nwho are in the third year of their study. They are responsible for heading various wings of the club and its management.\nThe team of\nSub-heads\nis responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the club and the execution of its plans. It consists of students in the second year of their studies.\nAssociates\nare the first years who have a passion to win and are generally business-oriented. These members are oriented towards gaining as much knowledge as they can from the pool of knowledge available to the seniors.\nThe functional structure of the Business Club consists of three wings –\nfinance, analytics, and strategy\n. These wings include all that happens within the world of business.\nActivities\nIntra-Club activities\nTo prepare the associates for the sub-head tenure, they are encouraged to participate in various activities to lay a strong foundation in the three domains of Analytics, Finance, and Strategy. These activities include:\nIntra-club case study Competition\n- The associate batch is divided into small groups and each team is allotted a sub-head as a mentor, who guides the associate batch in solving the problem statement. On the D-day, the executive batch judges the teams through their presentations, and valuable inputs are given.\nKnowledge meets\n- Organising knowledge meetings is the way by which knowledge dissipation happens in the Club. These meetings are conducted by Club members, where they meet and brainstorm on various topics of interest. A strong network consisting of resourceful seniors and mentor professors clarifies any doubts the members may have and make the meetings fruitful.\nWhitepaper -\nThis event is organized so that the associates could choose and research the topic of their choice in the domain of the three wings of the B-club. During the event, Associates put around 20 days of research and at the end present their papers in front of the executive and sub-head Batch, where they give useful insights into the topic\nDrafting modules and blogs -\nClub members design modules and blogs in the three wings. These modules are released through the public handle.\nSummer program\nDuring the Summer holidays, many first-years apart from the Associate Batch are selected for the program as Summer Associates.\nCase study competition\n- This is the second intra-club case study competition. This time associates are made to solve the problem statement on their own without the mentorship of seniors, considering they have already done the courses in the three domains.\nAnalytics competition\n- This competition concentrates on the core of machine learning. Associates are given a data set and this competition demands writing algorithms without using built-in libraries and maximizing the accuracy score on the given dataset.\nTrading Competition -\nDuring this competition Associates and Summer Associates create a mock trading account. This competition lasts for 10 days and associates carry out intraday trading based on the technical and fundamental analysis they have learned in the program.\nAt the end of the summer program, based on the performance and participation in the summer program, associates are selected to be the part of sub-head batch.\nEvents organized by the Club\nThe club conducts a wide range of activities such as open house sessions and case studies enabling students to develop their business acumen by applying their skills and finding solutions to real-world problem statements.\nIndian Case Challenge\nEver since its inception in 2012, the Indian Case Challenge provides the best platform for undergraduate and graduate students from all over India to compete against each other and prove their business and entrepreneurial mettle in a real-life business case scenario. Not only are the participants expected to have strong business skills and financial understanding, but also a feeling for entrepreneurship and a sense of realizing market opportunities.\nICC 2021, organized in association with Kshitij, was a huge success and received a whopping 3200+ unique registrations, including international participation.\nOpen House Sessions\nBusiness Club strives to impart basic knowledge regarding the various facets of business, in an attempt to make the students of IIT Kharagpur more equipped to thrive in the ever-evolving global industry. Open house sessions on basic finance, analytics, and strategy that are conducted in conjunction with organizations such as Alphabeta, ZS Associates, and IIMC Consulting Club have gone a long way towards this.\nWebinars\nInformative webinars, presided by renowned speakers who excel in their respective business fields, are conducted by the club, to enrich the knowledge of the students even in online mode.\nGovernors and Heads\n2014-15\nGovernors\nSarthak Badjatiya\nShramajit Gupta\nVirendra Singh\nHeads\nAnalytics: Pranay Yadav\nConsultancy: Pratyush Devliyal\nFinance: Umang Mavani\nTechnical: Ravikiran Shinde\n2015-16\nGovernors\nAshutosh Dwivedi\nNishant Jayaswal\nShiladitya Saha\nHeads\nAnalytics: Raunak Chitlangia, Shubhrit Agrawal\nConsultancy: Manik Aggarwal\nFinance: Dhruva Ratanpura\nTechnical: Murtaza Phalasiya, Rajat Bhavnani\nLogistics: Rihen Chheda, Ritwik Bajaj\n2016-17\nGovernors\nPriya Mehta\nKumar Sparsh\nUdit Sarin\nHeads\nAnalytics: Charu Agarwal, Shwetha Krishnamurthy\nFinance: Debjyoti Chakrabarti\nConsultancy: Medha Asija\nTechnical: Shubham Singhal, Vaibhav Chauhan\n2017-18\nGovernors\nHarsh Agarwal\nHitendra Pratap\nShubhra Agrawal\nHeads\nAnalytics: Ankit Agarwal, Subham Rajgaria\nFinance: Ankit Agarwal, Rajat Ragha, Shubham Sharma\nStrategy: Shubham Maheshwari\nBlogs and Articles: Rahul Raj\nDesign: Anjali Bharti\n2018-19\nGovernors\nAman Sharma\nNikita Kishore\nHeads\nAnalytics: Yash Jain\nFinance: Amandeep Singh, Puneet Pansari\nStrategy: Amit Gunjan, Yogshree Choukse\n2019-20\nGovernors\nAditya Parashar\nDeepankar Sachdeva\nHeads\nAnalytics: Amrit Goswami, Chinmay Singh, Karan Mahajan\nFinance: Shreyansh Jain, Vikrant Gupta\nStrategy: Tushar Mohandas, Tushar Singla\nTechnical: Aditya Singhania\n2020-21\nGovernors\nAryan Saxena\nLakshraj Doshi\nShashank Singh\nHeads\nAnalytics: Arusarka Bose, Naman Paharia, Abhinav Bohra\nFinance: Sayantan Das, Lakshiyata Chhajer, Amur Khandelwal\nStrategy: Shivam, Gaurav Joshi, Inakshi Kar\n2021-22\nGovernors\nArya Uttamchandani\nSankalp Bose\nHeads\nAnalytics: Karan Uppal, Dikshant Pratap Singh\nFinance: Arnav Bhutda, Suhas Jain, Aditya Saha\nStrategy: Tejaswi Pagadala, Kashish Lundia\nWeb: Piyush Dhamane\nBranding and Public Relations: Deepansh Agrawal\n2022-2023\nGovernors\nMadiha Hanifa\nBharat Uday\nHeads\nAnalytics: Vaibhav Jalani\nStrategy: Siddharth Madupathi, Pragya Choudhary\nFinance: Ram Sundaram, Patel Yuti\nWeb and Design: Sai Kalyan Meghavath\n2023-2024\nGovernors\nSiddharth Dikshit\nShreeya Mishra\nHeads\nAnalytics: Adyan Rizvi, Ishan Ray, Lokesh Tirthani\nFinance: Suryaansh Jindal, Ojasvi R Singh\nStrategy: Atmajyoti Ghosh, Arya Vardhan Singh, Jash Mody\n2024-2025\nGovernors\nArnav Bansal\nAnshul Trehan\nHeads\nAnalytics: Arya Dighde\nFinance: Aman Samriya, Manya S.

        "content": "Note : Students who visit to do research work in Ireland are NOT called Interns, they are called Visiting Students. This distinction is extremely important to note because it will determine the type of VISA one should be applying for. And in case of any confusion OR before applying for the VISA, consult with your institute/lab/company for the procedure to follow and cross verify it with the Embassy of Ireland, New Delhi by dropping them a mail (They usually reply quickly).\nIf you are going to be a visiting student in Ireland for less than 90 days, then you will need to apply for a short stay visa. Apply well before your end semester exams to avoid hurrying and have ample safety time in case anything goes wrong.\nUsually, NO original documents are needed to be sent to you by your host institute to submit for VISA application. Color printouts and photocopy works. Check with your institute regarding this.\nThe following documents are required for submitting (not exhaustive, please cross check) :-\nColor printout of the Invitation/Acceptance Letter stating the duration of the research visit and any studentship you will be getting (Important)\nApplication Letter addressed to the Embassy of Ireland clearly stating your purpose and any important information (1-2 page, typed or hand written)\nBonafide certificate from the Institute\nProof of funds :- Original Bank statement of the last 6 months (starting from the month you are applying) or Original updated Passbook\nProof of accommodation (a printout of email communication works)\nFlight tickets confirmation printout if you have already booked.\nLetter of Recommendation (not mandatory but for safety)\nThe above list is a reference and there may be other documents required as per your case.\nOnline Application\nVisit the VFS Global Ireland website, navigate to India's page and follow the instructions given to make an application. Visit the\nINIS page\nfor help regarding VISA and the documents you have to submit.\nHelpful Information\nThe Embassy of Ireland is very helpful with VISA applications and will get back to you in case there are any missing documents in your application. If required by them OR if you missed submitting an important document at VFS, you can directly speed post the document to the Embassy after consulting with them. \nDo asks in Facebook groups and forums in case you are stuck with things but anything VISA related should be cross verified with the Embassy. They are the authority in that matter.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_get_a_visa_to_Ireland&oldid=84421\n\""

Security at the gates of the hall checked the ID Card of every student who was going into the hall.\nAfter entering the hall, students were milling around for about an hour or so, understanding the geography of the hall presumably and taking it all in, because this was the\nonly day\nthat they were going to be allowed inside the hall for the next 1 year. This was also the first time that they had a taste of the hall day culture. Much had been made of this tradition by most seniors from societies that about 1/4th of the UG 1st year batch were part of.\nAround 8:15 PM, trouble started when some unruly activities started on the top floor where some first year female students lived. Boys were being pushed out of the room and boxes of surf, tubes of toothpaste were being dumped and squeezed onto their clothes. Presumably, the girls residing in these rooms did not say anything to stop this distressing behavior (perhaps even vocally supporting it) and allowed the act to continue. Quickly, things escalated to a point where mattresses and pillows were being thrown from the second and first floors onto the garden on the ground floor which had been fixed for the Hall Day. Even until this point, this was nothing more than a joke. This is where the tone of things changed into a competition.\nMembers of various societies started forming human chains and singing songs and marching around the floors and the stair cases. These chains had both male and female members and they were going from a room of one of their members to another one of their members. Allegedly, all the members were from first year, and although seniors were residing in this part of the hall, they did not intervene.\nSome seniors from 3rd and 4th years were seen walking around the in the ground in the center of the hall where the mattresses were being thrown and trying to convince people vocally to stop throwing things and behaving in an unruly manner. This call to regain control and stop the events went mostly unheeded.\nThe whole destruction went on for about an hour unchecked, due to some gross mishandling by the MT Hall President, VP TSG and the hall security guards, who were present on the premises for the whole evening but did not act.\nAt 9:15 pm - 9:30 pm, the hall day was brought to an end (approximately 30 minutes before the scheduled end), and everyone was asked to leave. All the men were herded around and summarily expelled from the hall. The mood among most students was celebratory. It is safe to assume that the destruction that they had done and the consequences of the same had not yet sunk in. After the hall-day, discussion regarding what happened was mostly done with a fair bit of humor and the event was filed away in memory for nearly 2 weeks. Some girls whose rooms were trashed talked about how it was unfair for their LAN ports to be broken and their only fault being that they had invited their friends into their rooms.\nTimeline\nMT Hall Day 2014\n7th March, 2014\nFirst official communique from VPTSG condemning the event\n9th March, 2014\nFirst meeting between the VP TSG, TSG office bearers and UG 1st year batch\n19th March, 2014: 6 pm\nSecond meeting between the VP TSG, Hall presidents of several senior halls and\nentire\nUG 1st year batch\n19th March, 2014: 9 pm\nInterrogation of girls from MT\n-- TODO -- (This will be a range)\nList of students who were to be punished with 2 months of community service released\n-- TODO --\nA list of things that happened\nFans bent out of shape (see image)\nBeds thrown from as high up as the third floor onto the ground floor\nLAN ports broken\nObscene phrases on the walls of some rooms (references to the male and female reproductive organs using slang terms in English and Hindi)\nAftermath\nAdministration\nAt the time of this event, the following were the people who held different important positions.\nPosition\nOffice bearer\nPresident\nTSG\nProf. Joy Sen\nVice President\nTSG\nApoorv Jain\nUndergraduate Representative to the senate\nIshan Garg\nDean (Student Affairs)\nProf. N R Mandal\nHall President (MT Hall)\n-- TODO --\nHall President (SN/IG Hall)\nShriti Bhosale\nEmails sent by the VP TSG\nThe Vice President (TSG) at the time of the incident was Apoorv Jain. On 9th March, 2014, he sent an email to all students enclosing images of the destruction caused. He severely condemned this event. The attached images immediately found their way to Facebook, and subsequently to Quora where several questions asking \"why\" these events had happened at a prestigious institute such as IIT Kharagpur. As most first year students were dazed by the destruction they had enabled and participated in, no one had thought or been allowed to take pictures before being expelled from MT Hall. Pictures that did exist had not been widely circulated or posted on Facebook. So, in essence, if the VP TSG had decided not to include pictures of the destruction in his email, there would have been none in public circulation for anyone to look at.\nDear Students,\n\nThis letter is in regards to the recent occurrence of damage to institute property on 7th March, 2014 during Mother Teresa Hall Day. In a span of fifteen minutes, furniture in the rooms of several first year undergraduate students was either broken, damaged beyond repair or thrown from the top floors. Furthermore, the walls were defaced with obscene graffiti. The fact that few students indulged in such act of vandalism reflects poorly on the entire student community of IIT Kharagpur.\n\nThis heinous act of mass wreckage showed lack of respect for institute property and, more importantly, lack of character and morals in the offenders, and has left the student community of IIT Kharagpur equivalent of street ragamuffins. This kind of crude behaviour as shown in pictures attached is not expected of students of the forerunner of the IITs. IIT Kharagpur is not a mere academic institution, we boast of a rich fraternal culture, which is developed through a deep sense of gratitude towards the institute. Sadly, incident like this have raised a question on whether our freedom is compromising our civility and whether we deserve such infrastructural facilities.\n\nWe, the Office bearers of Technology Students' Gymkhana and all Hall Presidents are extremely disturbed by this irresponsible and dishonourable behaviour of our own students. Visibly, students have failed to capture the real essence of Hall Days. We hope students understand the gravity of the situation and refrain from such undignified activities in future.\n\nThank you\nWith Regards\nApoorv Jain\nVP,TSG\nOn 19th March, 2014, at around 8 am, he sent this email to all the UG 1st year students.\nDear Students,\n\nToday, Prof N R Mandal (Dean, SA) will address all the UG 1st year students regarding MT Hall Day incident. So, all the students are kindly requested to be present in Netaji Auditorium at 6.30 pm.\n\nThank you\n\nWith Regards\n\nApoorv Jain\nVP,TSG\nMeetings between the student community and the VP TSG\nFirst meeting\nOn 19th March, 2014, the whole UG 1st year batch (students who joined in 2013) was called for a meeting at Netaji Auditorium at 6:30 pm. Apoorv Jain sent out this email at around 8 am that morning.\nThis meeting was attended by then Dean (Student Affairs) Prof N R Mandal, then President TSG Prof. Joy Sen, VP TSG Apoorv Jain and a few hall presidents. The turn out at the 6:30 pm meeting was very less. (approximately 50-70 people out of a total UG 1st year batch of 1400 people)\nThe meeting was delayed and students who were present there were intimidated into manually calling their friends to the venue, this marginally increased the turn out. The intimidation was done by the VP TSG who was present there, along with some fourth year hall presidents who were visibly angry and disappointed with the turnout. Absurd threats were made against the few obedient students who had turned up. Eg:\nAgar tumhara pura batch yahan nahi aayega, to yahan pe jitne bhi log hain, tum sab pe DC baithegi. Phir udhar jaake jawaab de dena.\n(If your whole batch doesn't get here, all of you who are present here will be acted upon by the Disciplinary Committee. You can then explain your situation there.)\nAround 7:30 pm, the professors arrived at\nNetaji Auditorium\n. A long address followed. Students present at this meeting were informed that the 12 day delay was because of then DOSA Prof. N R Mandal being out of station and thus being unable to act on the events. This delay was not to be misinterpreted as an unwillingness to act. Allusions were also made to the VP, President and other professors of the institute getting phone calls from alumni regarding the MT Hall Day incident. One of the things that stood out at this meeting, which was discussed for several weeks after this meeting, was Prof. Joy Sen's famous reference to the 1979 Mel Gibson classic\nMad Max\n. He particularly pointed out the end of the 1979 movie where Mel Gibson's character Max loses control over himself, after losing his family, and kills several members of the gang that was involved in the death of his wife and his infant son. Prof. Sen's was trying to draw an analogy between the behavior of a few out of control freshman and the protagonist in a movie who does something explicable, but rather bizarre. While most people at this first meeting had not seen the movie Prof. Sen was talking about, it was clear to almost everyone present that he was grappling with what had happened and trying to make sense of it using the appreciated principle of \"life imitating art\"\nStudents present there were also informed by the VP TSG that there was widespread disappointment in the behavior of the UG 1st year students, and that since the General Championships had been suspended right after the incident on 7th March, there was considerable anger among students in senior batches.\nAll professors present at the meeting were irritated with the low turnout and left about 1 hour after the meeting started in an agitated state. Apoorv Jain then decided to convene a complete UG 1st year batch meeting at 9 pm that night. There was widespread panic about what the consequences would be. There were several threats (such as mass Disciplinary Committee action, barring from placement, etc) which were indirectly made by the VP TSG and other hall presidents present at the meeting. The ultimatum was to get the whole batch at Netaji Auditorium at 9 pm and then, the discussion would be about the possible recourse that could be taken to mitigate the event's fall out.\nSecond meeting\nThe second meeting began at 9 pm and saw much higher turnout, with almost the whole UG 1st year batch turning up. People were found in MMM and LBS Halls of residences literally running around calling their friends and everyone in 1st year to this meeting. There was widespread panic regarding the threats that had been made. Notably, none of the professors came to this meeting. The meeting was attended by the hall presidents of Patel, Nehru, MT, SN/IG, apart from then VP TSG. This was viewed as a scare tactic, as some of the hall presidents referred to the absence of Orientation Procedure / OP for first years was somehow responsible for this behavior. Their direct implication was that people were running around wild because they had not been \"trained in the ways of KGP\". Referring to the suspension of the GCs as a result of the main incident, one of the Hall Presidents said,\nTum logon ko pata nahi hain ki iska kya matlab hain, sab log bahut gusse mein hain. Agle sal jab tum log senior hall jaoge to tumhe pata chalega\n(You don't know about the importance of the GCs being suspended, everyone is angry about this. You all will face the consequences for this next year, when you go to senior halls)\nSome of the options discussed in this meeting included a reduced community service for the whole UG 1st year batch, so as to save a few people from getting a lot of the punishment. When the students present in the auditorium were asked,\nAre you all willing to take the blame and stay back and do community service for the summer, so that not just a few of your friends face really bad consequences?\n, a few students immediately shot down the idea. The general consensus among students who had not attended the hall day, had not witnessed the incident, and/or were completely not involved in the incident was that they should not have to pay with their time for the mistakes of a few groups of people.\nThe VP TSG made an effort to try to get traction for the shared punishment idea. He asked if anyone would like to defend it and try to convince their batch mates. Understandably, students who had been spotted by many people as being the main players in the destruction were in total support of this idea of shared blame to reduce the punishment. They were seen visibly confused and voiced their concerns with one student standing up and addressing the rest of the auditorium:\nDekh lo yaar, sab log lenge blame toh sirf ek mahina rehna padega, nahi toh pata nahi kya hoga.\n(If everyone takes the blame, the punishment will be very less and everyone would have to stay back only for 1 month. If not, we don't know what the punishment might be)\nTensions were even higher than at the previous meeting because for the first time Apoorv Jain said that one of the common punishments doled out after disciplinary committee hearings were \"semester backlogs\nwhich implied that a student will be disbarred from registering for one semester and hence would be unable to complete their course on time. Apart from this, this would also be in the official record of the student including the final grade transcript.\nConsequence\nA group of 27 1st year students were told to undergo community service for 2 months during the summer months of May and June 2014. There was no other official record made anywhere regarding this event.\n[\nunverified\n]\nDiscussion\nThe events of MT Hall Day 2014 were a classic case of the Bandwagon effect. The destruction was started by a small subset of people attending the Hall Day. It started as a joke, and eventually turned into a competition between the various societies on campus.\nInterestingly, some of the women who resided in the hall, who were acting as hosts in the hall day decided to preclude the possibility of destruction by locking themselves inside their rooms and not letting anyone in. Some of the male friends of these women who had locked their doors to outsiders then tried to fish them out of there by filling buckets with water and then throwing them into the room using the slit under the door. It must be noted that a similar method is used to lure cockroaches out of hiding spots in kitchen drains, that must definitely have been the source of this particular strategy.\nWhile some other women decided to give in, and some even participated in the destruction of their friend's rooms. Claims can also be made about this being a direct application of the herd behaviour in real life. There have been\nseveral\nriots in the past that have been attributed to this particular characteristic of human behaviour.\nOn a brighter side, there were people who were trying to stop this from happening. Shushman Choudhury (CS, '15) was on the ground floor and was trying to stop people from throwing down mattresses by shouting at them. He gave up after about 15 minutes of this (it was rather dangerous to stand on the ground floor where the possibility of a mattress hitting you is non-significant), but it must be said that it must have taken considerable courage to even try to do something like this against a mob, that for all practical purposes, had lost all control on themselves and had stopped computing the turn of events, the consequences of the same and the state of the hall as it stood around them.\nLess attention is paid to the aftermath and the administration's response to this event. The administration decided to witch-hunt a small group of people and decided to get a list of names and proceed with punishing them. They decided to talk to the women whose rooms were trashed in an attempt to get the names of their male friends who did the trashing out of them. This strategy didn't work out well at first. Most women flat out refused to talk. Soon, the administration started using the only chip they had: threatening the woman with disciplinary proceedings for not cooperating. Soon enough, it was clear to all the women that this was not going away and that they had to come up with names or get ready to face the heat of saving their friends.\nGiven a choice, several women chose to name a few friends who they thought would be wildly off the administration's radar and it would be very hard to actually punish them because it would be obvious to everyone that these people were not responsible, but the administration didn't care about this and went ahead and prepared the list of 40-50 people who were going to do the community service in the summer. This list had a few people who had been included because only the first name had been provided by the women and there were several people with that name in the UG batch. One such person got his father to fly out to Kharagpur and talk to the director directly about what was going on and why this kind of mob justice was being handed out. His name was removed from the list subsequently.\nThe names of some other people were also included in this list although their connection to the events was non-existent. People who had been at home during the weekend of the events or who had been in the hall for a very short period of time were on this list. Some people were able to get their names off the list.\nThe administration's tactics were simple: they set about intimidating 18 year olds into tattling on their friends. While many might imagine that in the same situation, they would have behaved in an honorable manner, one is forced to imagine what the conditions must have been like if nearly 50 names could be squeezed out of a population of highly un-cooperative women.\nSee Also\nHall Day\nReferences\n↑\n\"Open Letter of Condemnation | MT Hall day\"\n- VP TSG 2013-2014 Apoorv Jain\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=2014-03-07_MT_Hall_Day_Incident&oldid=97174\n\""

It is a research group sponsored by\nSRIC\nas part of\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics\n.

The\nTRS\nheads then liked the idea and decided to go ahead with it and ordered a simple quadrotor chassis and ESCs worth INR 7000 only. With absolutely no prior knowledge about aerial robots or control systems, couple of students started tinkering with IMUs and ESCs spoiling them, burning them and eventually learning how to use them. However, a lack of direction to the project often demotivated the people involved. So, in early 2014, the direction was decided i.e. to participate in\nIARC\nwhich was a much further goal compared to the situation then. With newly found direction, the small group started with attempting to fly the chassis and almost got it when the ESCs and IMUs burnt stalling for months. In August 2014, one of the students bought an AR Drone during his internship.  This sped up work by a huge margin as students now could divide into two team - software and controls, the former working on the purchased drone and the latter on flying the chassis. \nIn October 2014, the idea of\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics\nwas floated and students working on this attempted to get funded through it.  Aditya Agarwal made a research proposal and roped in\nProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay\nand Prof. D.K.Pratihar as mentors for the project and applied for funding. Mrinal Mohit pitched in by taking his BTP on Visual SLAM from aerial drone under\nProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay\n. The proposal was accepted and the fund was received in\nSRIC\nin January 2015 and the group\nARK\nwas officially formed.\n[\n1\n]\nA complete lab setup was finally ready by August 2015 for testing drones indoor and finally a new drone with a new chassis was first hovered in the lab in September 2015.\n[\n1\n]\nList of Student Coordinators\nList of Past Coordinators\n[\n2\n]\n:\n2014: Aditya Agarwal (EC '15)\n2015: Soumyadeep Mukherjee (CH '16)\n2016: Gaurav Gardi (PH '18)\nActivities\nList of activities ARK is involved in\n[\n1\n]\n:\nInternational Aerial Robotics Competition\nIARC is the longest running collegiate aerial robotics challenge in the world.

Since then, the team has been involved in the development of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The team developed its first vehicle ‘Kraken 1.0’ in June 2011, overcoming hurdles like cost, manufacturability, efficient design and limited time. The team then went on to win the first ever national event on AUVs at NIOT and participated in the 14th international AUVSI ROBOSUB Competition in San Diego, USA.\nAs a first time participant, the team matched up to more established teams and cleared the qualifying round. The performance and efforts of the team were recognized and appreciated by the judges.The team is determined to develop cutting-edge technology to overcome challenges and perform better. With better resources, experience and the able guidance of the research group involved in the development of the very first AUV of India, the team is working with zeal and enthusiasm to surpass the achievements of previous years.\nCurrently in 2019, the AUV team is working on \"\nKraken 4.0\n\".\nSource :\nhttp://auviitkgp.github.io/\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=AUV&oldid=88129\n\""

        "content": "Robotics\nat IIT Kharagpur is worked on, promoted, and propagated by the activities of several technical societies and student run research groups. The\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics\nis the umbrella organisation of all robotics related activities, and is currently funding 12 research projects through\nSRIC\n. These projects are in multiple departments involving fields varying from humanoid, aerial vehicles, social assistants, underwater vehicles and more.\nIn addition to doing research, many of the groups participate in national and international robotics competitions, providing the involved students an opportunity to learn more about the advancements pushing forward the field of robotics. The competitions include\nIGVC\n,\nFIRA\n,\nIARC\n,\nRobocup\n,  and\nRoboSub\n. Robotics is also a popular field for the\nInter-Hall hardware exhibition\nwhere many halls develop products on robotics and automation, including a wall climbing human skeleton, a bomb diffusing robot, a gesture-controlled arm, a humanoid robot, all-terrain vehicles and transforming robots.\n[\n1\n]\nHistory\nA \"Lumos\" robot, showcased at Robotix 2013.\nRobotics at IIT Kharagpur has a long history which, until recently, revolved around initiatives by students. It started in the form of a small student run society called\nTechnology Robotix Society\n, with the aim of spreading the culture of robotics in Kharagpur and India, in the year 2001. The society formed a group called the\nKharagpur Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Group\n(KRAIG), which was a group of students who would teach hobby robotics to students in IIT Kharagpur. Over time, they started doing workshops across India in colleges like NIT Durgapur, JIIT, BIT Mesra and many more. As they popularised robotics in India, in order to keep the wheel running, they came up with Robotix, the annual robotics competition. The fest became a hub of hobby robotics and a huge platform for people across the country involved in hobby robotics to meet and showcase their skills.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nA\ndifferential drive\nrobot built by first years in\nKRAIG\n.\nFile:Agvteam.jpg\nTeam AGV\nSoon, robotics started becoming more popular and students started shifting from hobby robotics to robotics research. They started participating and performing in competitions like\nDRDO Ground Vehicle\nand IIT Kharagpur hosted Robocup@India in 2009\n[\n4\n]\nwith the help of\nProf. Pedro Lima\n, former trustee of Robocup foundation and\nAamir Ahmad\n. This brought the attention of professors on campus initiating two of the oldest robotics projects at IIT Kharagpur –\nAGV\nand\nKRSSG\n.\n[\n3\n]\nFile:KRSSGteam.jpg\nTeam KRSSG with Bronze Trophy in Dajeon, South Korea during FIRA 2015.\nAs more students started to show interest in robotics, professors\nC.S.Kumar\nand\nD. K. Pratihar\nfrom the Department of Mechanical Engineering started offering projects in robotics.\n[\n5\n]\nTwo courses were also started on robotics in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. With the advent of robotics in IIT Kharagpur, a proposal for a Centre for Excellence in Robotics was drafted with the initiative of Prof.\nPartha Pratim Chakrabarti\n, with the help of multiple professors and Nalin Gupta, a final year student and then Student Coordinator of\nAGV\nin August 2014.\n[\n1\n]\nThis included 10 robotics project proposals from multiple departments, students and professors.\n[\n3\n]\nIn December 2014, the proposal was accepted, and included 12 projects and a total fund of ₹ 5 crore approved through the Institute and Centre for Excellence in Robotics\n[\n5\n]\nwas kick-started with\nProf. D. K. Pratihar\nas its \"Overall Coordinator\".\n[\n5\n]\n[\n3\n]\nCurrently, all 12 projects are running independently funded through Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy (SRIC).\n[\n3\n]\nCourses\nCurrently, IIT Kharagpur officially offers only three courses related to robotics, all in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.\n[\n5\n]\nSubject Number\nCourse Name\nProfessor\nME60352\nRobotics\nDilip Kumar Pratihar\nME60416\nMechanisms and Robot Kinematics\nCheruvu Siva Kumar\nMF30003\nRobots and Computer Controlled Machines\nDilip Kumar Pratihar, Asimava Roy Chowdhury\nHowever, many courses related to robotics are taught in different departments, such as Image Processing, Embedded Systems, Control Systems.\nRobotics in Inter-Hall Hardware Modelling Competition\nOriginal Article:\nInter-Hall hardware exhibition\nThis section requires\nexpansion\n.\nAlumni involved in robotics-related activities\nSumandeep Banerjee - Co-founder + former CTO,\n3DPhy\nHema Swetha\n- Doctoral student in Computer Science, Cornell University\nDr. Aamir Ahmad\n- Post Doctoral Fellow in Robotics, Max Planck Institute of Biological Cybernetics\nSanjiban Choudhury\n- Doctoral student in Robotics, Carnegie Mellon University\nIshani Chatterjee\n- Masters student in Robotics, Carnegie Mellon University\nShushman Choudhury\n- Masters student in Robotics, Carnegie Mellon University\nMrinal Mohit\n- Masters student in Camera Culture, Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nStartups\n3DPhy\nAuro Robotics\nSee Also\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics\nKharagpur Robosoccer Students' Group\nKharagpur Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Group\nTechnology Robotix Society\nReferences\n↑\n1.0\n1.1\nVerified\nby\nDementor\non September 21, 2015.\n↑\n\"Robot festival at IIT Kharagpur\"\n.
