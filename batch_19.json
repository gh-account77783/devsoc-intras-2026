You will be informed about the dates from before. Moreover, each section will have a different paper set up by the TAs. So be ready to see a complete level of difference in all the sections' papers. Some will be damn easy and some will be a hard nut to crack.\nAttendance in tutorials is counted in TA marks (it depends on the group of professors teaching the subject in a particular semester)\nStudent Opinion\nPhysics WAS(special emphasis) considered to be one of the subjects which could get you good grades if you are thorough with the slides and practised the problems of Somnath BHaradwaj book (till Autmun 2017). Several students could get EX grades and most of the questions were simply formula based and involved very little concept.\nIt was the Spring Semester in 2018 that turned the table around. The grading scheme was changed from relative to absolute.\nTill 2017 Autumn it was-\nBOOKLET TYPE QUESTION CUM ANSWER SCRIPT: Enough space is provided so don't be worried except if you have the habit of cutting the entire answer and doing it again and again.\nBut in Spring Sem it changed backed to full length answer script giving you scope for extra pages.\nThe standard of the paper went very high. The questions were abstract and conceptual and required you to think very deep and apply concept at each and every point from scratch.\nAlmost 121 students received F in Spring semester compared to only 8 in the Autumn Semester.\nHere are some tips to crack the paper:\n1. Be thorough with your concepts such that you can start things right from the scratch.\n2. Don't rely fully on slides, read good study material like  Saraswat and Sastry and Physics-1 by Somnath Bharadwaj to get hold of the basic concepts.\n3. Do solve all the sums in Somnath and SAraswat Sastry (They are directly copied from IE Irodov except some problems of Polarisation and Entire QM). Get hold of the solutions of Irodov\n[1]\n.\n4. If you want to really do good, read AP French book\n[2]\nfor oscillations and waves portion and it would be awesome to read Ajoy Ghatak's book on Optics\n[3]\n. They will safeguard you from losing marks. Also solve sums from both the books.\n5. If you have time, you can go through MIT OCW lecture\n[4]\n(but make sure you don't sacrifice other subjects as well).\nHow to Crack the Paper\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nInstiinfo Repository\nTime Table\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=PH11001:_Physics&oldid=57095\n\""

        "content": "HS13001\nCourse name\nEnglish For Communication\nOffered by\nHumanities & Social Sciences\nCredits\n4\nL-T-P\n3-0-2\nPrevious Year Grade Distribution\n81\n233\n402\n486\n101\n8\n2\nEX\nA\nB\nC\nD\nP\nF\nSemester\nSpring\nSyllabus mentioned in ERP\nThe aim of this foundational course is to help the second language learners acquire fluency in both spoken and written English to communicate messages with clarity, precision and confidence in the workplace. The course will have three components: Language, Speaking and Writing. The skills required in these areas will be imparted through Lectures and Sessionals. While lectures will introduce learners to the basic concepts in communication, sessionals will provide handson experience. It is hoped that after commanding the skills required in spoken and written English, learners will be able to communicate better.\nSection A (Lecture topics)\nIntroduction to communication, Language and grammar skills, speaking skills, Writing skills\nSection B (Sessionals)\nBuilding Vocabulary, Building sentences, Grammar, Pronunciation drills, Phonetics, vowels, Diphthongs, consonants, Stress, Rhythm and intonation, Conversational skills, Meta Language, the writing process, Writing with a thesis, Writing topic sentences, Writing a paragraph, linking paragraph.\nConcepts taught in class\nAs far as theory is concerned you will be basically taught a set of poems and proses with a very deep analysis. There is no grammar or writing component in the theory component of the course. So dont let the ERP syllabus divert you.\nThe lab classes are concerned with your communication skills and the teaching style and content varies from class to class.\nSome sections had more emphasis on phonetics and pronunciation for a longer time while other sections would focus on professional speaking skills and some basic skills used in Group Discussion and some advanced concepts like Non Verbal Communication and the development of Music and Art. It will be a nice experience and you will get to know your friends better.\nStudent Opinion\nRelative Grading\nThe midsem and endsem tests are common for all sections. What varies is the lab class evaluation. In some sections, professors do take class tests in pen and paper mode for the Theory component. If Prof. Seema Singh is your Theory teacher, then you are most likely to have 2 movie tests in Vikramshila where you will be shown a one hour movie and then do a critical analysis of it. It was an open internet and resource test. And at the end of the semester she takes a theory test where each student gets a random poem and he/she has to answer the MCQs in it. One can use internet (but its not that easy, the questions are designed ina way that you analyse through the internet and then develop an understanding.)\nIn labs too, evaluation and activities vary.\nBe careful about attendance because several students get deregistered on account of their attendance. One can't give proxy as some profs take attendance themselves.\nGetting an Ex in this course is not at all a cakewalk. The teachers expect you to write mature and fresh answers. You need to touch the historical background and the cultural volume of the texts and write detailed answers with elaborated but precise information. Many people take this course lightly but you really need to have a strong grip on the texts to be able to write good answers in the exams and get a good grade. Again, the checking is quite strict so you must keep an eye on your grammar and spellings in the answer. A neat handwriting and underlining of important phrases with a pencil is appreciated.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nWell let me clearly define the steps needed to do so:\n1.As soon as the semester starts, jot down the syllabus of the midsem and endsem as per timing.(Both are different and they might be mailed to you).If not then prompt your teacher to do so.\n2. The question paper structure is as follows:\na. Unseen passage with MCQs (Passages are almost of the same level that you encounter in CBSE class 12 English).\n b. MCQ questions from poems and proses taught in the class.\n c. 2 or 3 long answer type analysis questions. You have to fill atleast 2-3 pages.\n3. For part a. practise of sample papers and paragraphs would be enough.\n4. For part b. read all the poems and proses taught in the class line by line (not depth and with deep meaning). Have a surface reading and also take special care of new and special words mentioned behind the chapter. They ask those meanings sometimes.\n5. Part c. is the major mark deciding area. You will have a choice to select 1 or 2 from all poems and proses taught seperately. When your semester starts decide the chapter on which you will write the long answer. Draft a 2 or 2 .5 page answer which will include a general analysis of the poem or prose involved by seeing some good sites in Google.Don't forget to write Author's name, place and date of birth, year of publication of poem or prose. If you attatch some movies or songs(dont forget to mention band or singer name) based on the theme of the chapter. The remaining half page will be based on what the question wants or the specification of the question, which you have to develop on your own in the exam hall.\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nInstiinfo Repository\nTime Table\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=HS13001:_English_For_Communication&oldid=103651\n\""

It is a dynamic and intellectually stimulating community for students passionate about the study and application of game theory. It had organised various game theory-related events like\nNashify\n,\nWar of Wits\n, Brethren of the Coast and Finance Talk in previous years, designed to promote a culture of game theory on the campus. The Society’s flagship event is Stratathon, a mind-intriguing strategy case competition featured in\nKshitij\n, the Techno-Management fest of IIT Kharagpur, every year.\nHistory\nFounding\nThe\nKGPian Game Theory Society\nwas founded on 19th August 2010 by\nManoj Gadia (07-12)\n. It is a student body which organizes various\nGame Theory\nrelated programs. With a motive of spreading awareness, knowledge and application of Game Theory, first official session of society was 15th June 2011 to 14th June 2012. Since then the society has seen tremendous growth over the years and witnessed good response from students and game theory enthusiasts. By the able guidance and vision of it's founder Manoj Gadia, this society has grown to become a family with more than 50 members.\nMotive\nThe Society was founded with a main motive to promote concepts of Game Theory and Strategic Thinking. Many situations in people's lives make them choose between different options and we always intend to optimize our chances and get the best outcome. This is where Game Theory comes into play. The outcomes decided by the situations provoke us to analyze them statistically and hence choose the optimal solution through various methods and statistics. This society promotes these concepts by various means.\nActivities\nThe Art of Strategy Project\nThis project is started under the advice of Prof. Avinash Dixit, emeritus professor of Princeton University. Society members undergo this self-learning program throughout the year to develop their strategic thinking skills. The Society also makes original questions based on strategic decision-making to compile it as a question bank.\nDiscussion Sessions\nIn discussion sessions, senior members conduct discussion sessions for all the members, explaining the various theoretical concepts, along with interesting games and real-life examples.\nCase Studies\nSociety members practice solving case studies using game theory in our academic meetings. Senior members solve real life case studies in the fields of business and economics.\nGames\nIn society meetings, members play strategy-based games among themselves to learn how to use game theory concepts in a given situation. The games are usually in accordance with the concepts being covered during discussion sessions.\nEvents\nWar of Wits (WOW)\nMain article:\nWar of Wits\nIt is an annual on-spot strategy based competition for students of IIT Kharagpur.
