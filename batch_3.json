        "content": "Note:\nFor this guide, we will assume that SERVER is the IP Address of the server you want to SSH into. USER is the name of your username. You need to have the package openssh-client installed on your computer, and the package openssh-server on your server. You need appropriate user access on SERVER so that you can edit files inside the privileged '\n/etc'\nfolder.\nYou can only SSH to servers that have their SSH Daemon listening on the port 443. Port 22 (default) is blocked on the campus network, and can't be used to SSH.\nRemote servers usually don't listen to port 443 by default, to change that you need to ssh into the server and change the setting. Hence you temporarily need an internet connection that doesn't have any port restrictions.\nA common method to do this is to use mobile data on your phone, and start a hotspot, once done, you will have complete Internet access. If your server provider provides a web console access, you can use that to add make the following changes too. Also see the next section.\nAnother method to achieve this would be to SSH into a server that you have configured with this guide before, and then SSH from that server into USER@SERVER\nWith the unrestricted connection SSH normally into your server (\nssh USER@SERVER\n). On your server, edit the file\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config\n, and add\nPort 443\nin a new line after\nPort 22\nNow, save the file, and restart the ssh daemon. Depending on your system, there might be several ways to restart a service. For instance,\n'\nsudo service ssh restart'\n(Ubuntu based systems)\nUsing the administrator console of your server provider (AWS Console or Digital Ocean Droplets)\nNow, turn off the mobile data and hotspot setup, and reconnect to the Institute WiFi or LAN\nInstall\ncorkscrew\n('\nautomake --add-missing'\nfollowed by '\nautoreconf'\nfollowed by '\n./configure'\nfollowed by '\nmake'\nand finally '\nmake install'\n)\nInside the file\n~/.ssh/config\nadd the following lines, at the top of the file :\nHost\nmyserver\nUser\nmyuser\nHostname\nmyserver.com\nProxyCommand\ncorkscrew\n172\n.16.2.30\n8080\n%h\n%p\nIdentityFile\n/home/user/.ssh/id_file\nport\n443\nNote:\nYou will have to replace the values of User, Hostname and IdentityFile appropriately\nNote:\nRemove the line with IdentityFile if you want to login using password instead of SSH keys\nIf you are connecting an AWS server, please add HTTPS Port 443 to inbound rules of your chosen security group.\nNow you can SSH into the remote server from institute's network by executing\nssh myserver\nConfiguring Amazon AWS\nIf you have an Amazon AWS instance, you can allow the 443 port access by changing the inbound traffic rules in the instance management console. For instance, allowing the HTTPS traffic (through port 443) from IIT Kharagpur's IP or globally (0.0.0.0) should allow you to access the server directly.\nSee Also\nInstitute proxies\nInternet and LAN\nList of how-tos\nExternal Links\nArch Wiki: Secure Shell\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_SSH_into_a_server_that_is_outside_the_campus_network&oldid=23403\n\""

        "content": "Pravah\n, previously known as\nHindi Technology Dramatics Society (H.T.D.S.)\n,as the name suggests, is the\nofficial Hindi Dramatics Society\nof I.I.T. Kharagpur. It was founded\nin 1967\nby Mr. R.K Bagrodia.\nPravah comes under the Technology Students' Gymkhana and is a part of the Dramatics Subcommittee under the Social and Cultural Committee. Since its inception, Pravah has been highly successful in bringing the true spirit of theatre to life and in demonstrating the power of emotions and thoughts through its stage plays and nukkad nataks (Street Plays).\nThe society although, does not hold any bias to a particular language and\ndoes not consider proficiency in Hindi as a metric during selections\n, which is evident from the fact that many of its members are not well versed in Hindi, but continue to contribute with great enthusiasm.\nThe Pravah family, with 112 active members currently, boasts of individuals with a keen sense of theatrical and street art! Our members have also brought accolades to their halls with their performances in Hall dramatics and have featured in various Short Films for various productions by the Filmmaking club for Inter IIT Cultural Meets.\nTechnology Dramatics Society:Pravah\nActivities\nTheatre\nWebsite\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Pravaah\nInstagram :\nhttps://www.instagram.com/pravah_iitkgp/\nYouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFOMxsIY4gmOQiy7F5sFWxQ\nUnder\nTSG\nYes\nFunctioning\nSelection Procedure\nPravah auditions are held once per year, for the first years, in the first or second week of August for active membership for all four/five years. The society selects a batch of around 35 first years (UG/PG) at the beginning of the academic year soon after the welcome production. The selection procedure consists of tasks that judge voice modulation, intensity, speech and diction, confidence, and acting skills.\nIt is not at all necessary that you must have a proper hold of Hindi, to be a part of Pravah. Also in rare cases, auditions have been held for a second time if it is found that a lot of people have missed the selections.\nOrganizational Structure\nPravah has four governors appointed every year who govern the society and represent it in the Technology Student's Gymkhana. Training of freshers and overall co-ordination during productions, out-stations, and competitions are handled by the governors.\nList of Activities\nIntroductory Seminar(Welcome Production)\nThe first act of the year (referred to as the Welcome Production ) is performed during late-July to Early-August.This introduces the first year to Pravah and it’s various activities.\nFresher’s Workshop\nThe freshers are given a thorough training of theatre oriented workshops that teaches them the basics of dramatics. Skills like voice modulation, voice intensity, dramatization, body posture, stage movements, third forms, etc are taught in groups. First years along with the four governors train for three weeks at the T.O.A.T. (Tagore Open Air Theater). Occasional skits, monologues, and challenging impromptu are attempted to improve the versatility of the actor. Both PG and UG's first years are welcome to take part in the workshop. Other than teaching the very basics of dramatics these workshops are also a great place to meet new people and interact with the seniors of Pravah.\nFresher’s Production\nIt is the first act performed by the freshers. It is performed during late-October to early-November. For its first production of the year Pravah generally picks up comical plays to entertain the freshers. The main objective of this play is for the first years to get an experience of what a play is and to provide them with a chance to display their newfound skills.\nNukkad\nNukkad Natak is a form of art play whereas the actors perform on a street with a live audience. The purpose of Nukkad Natak is to spread awareness about important social/political issues that plague our society. Pravah participates in the nukkad natak event of Spring fest in the month of January.

TRS) is an official society under the\nTechnology Students' Gymkhana\n, IIT Kharagpur and is a focal point for activities and projects related to\nrobotics\nin the campus. With its reach expanding steadily each year, it has also cemented its position as one of the nerve centres of amateur robotics in India.\nHistory\nActivities\nTechnology Robotix Society (TRS) conducts many events throughout the year, specifically aimed at undergraduate students, with a general aim of spreading robotics culture in the campus and around.\nKRAIG Classes\nThe Kharagpur Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Group (KRAIG) classes are organized by TRS throughout the autumn semester each year and are open to be attended for all students. The main attendees being first year undergraduate students of the campus. The classes cover the basics of robotics, starting off with drives, mechanisms and then moving on to electronics, integrated circuits and finally to the basics of autonomous robotics.\nAnnual Winter Workshop\nThe annual winter workshop is conducted each year after the conclusion of the autumn semester. The workshops are mentored by second year robotics enthusiasts including TRS members and interested students are taught the concepts of either autonomous robotics or computer vision, and through that knowledge, attempt to tackle a relevant problem statement. Students are selected through a common test organized by TRS, based on the results of which problem statements and mentors are assigned to the students, which they try to tackle together in one week of time.\nKRISS\nKharagpur Robotics and Intelligent Systems Seminars (abbrv. KRISS) is an initiative to bring together people across departments and different years to discuss and exchange ideas related to more mature and nuanced areas of robotics\n[\nwhich?\n]\n. The primary motivation is to encourage feedback and potential collaboration between interested individuals and also to foster a general culture of research-oriented discussions.\nFreshers' challenges\nIn addition to the classes, TRS also organizes exclusively-for-freshers competitions like\nRobosoccer\nin which students are taught to build a basic differential drive and Pathfinder workshop in which they are taught to build a line follower without writing a single line of code.\nIn addition to all this, TRS also conducts workshops for robotics in other colleges in India.\nRobotics Projects\nIn the past numerous robotics projects have been initiated by Technology Robotix Society alumni, several of which have received independent funding and now have been converted to independent research groups in the campus. Presently, two research projects are being managed by TRS. They are the Quadrotor project and the Swarm project.\nAerial Robotics Kharagpur\nMain article:\nAerial Robotics Kharagpur\nQuadrotor is the unmanned aerial vehicle project taken up by Team Robotix, with the initiation taking place from the academic year 2014-15. The ultimate goal of the project is to participate and win in the I.A.R.C.(International Aerial Robotics Competition), which is a highly prestigious and contested global event with realistic and daunting problem statements.\nSwarm IIT Kharagpur\nMain article:\nSwarm IIT Kharagpur\nSwarm Robotics is a very rare project taken up by Team Robotix and there are very few labs which are dealing with swarm robotics in the country. The ultimate aim of this project is to enable a swarm of robots explore an unknown terrain.\nMakerspace\nMakerspace is an initiative of Team Robotix for encouraging the students to come up with bright ideas for developing robots that could make a change. It is a community-based open source hardware hacking lab to make prototypes of selected hardware implementations as well as a meeting ground for open software projects. TRS aims to undertake small scale projects under this wing to make an everlasting impact on the IIT Kharagpur robotics scenario. Makerspace Projects that have been completed till date include the 2D PLOTTER(A mini version which can print any graphic having size less than 120 * 240 mm), Automated Inventory Management, Self Learning Crawling Robot and the Inter-IIT TCTD challenge.\nProjects that have been undertaken and are in progress :\nQUADRUPED: The basic aim is to build a quadruped equipped with 4 wheels that moves using wheels on plane surfaces and uses its legs to climb stairs/ uneven surfaces.\nROBOTIC ARM:  To build a 5 degree-of-freedom robotic arm by 3 D printing the basic chassis and using servos, is the primary objective. The arm can then be used for a variety of research purposes.\nRobotix (fest)\nThe annual fest Robotix, conducted each year during Kshitij is the focal activity of the society in a year. With a footfall of over 2000 each year, it has turned into the largest single robotics based annual agglomeration in South Asia.\n[\nunverified\n]\nEvents during Robotix are conducted under three categories: manual, autonomous and programming/online. In the manual events, the participant handles the robot by using a remote control. The remote system may be wired or unwired. The robot then has to perform the specified task, which is usually something mechanical. In the autonomous events, the robots act independently; participants are not allowed to control them during their run. These robots typically use programmed micro-controllers to make decisions. Some events involve more than one robot, and can be a mix of autonomous and manually controlled robots. In the programming events, the participants are given a problem statement and submit code to solve the problem; the competitors are also allowed to submit their solutions online.\nRobotix 2019\nRobotix 2019 was held from 18-20 January, 2019.

All events had an X in their name to indicate ten years. The competition featured the following events:\nXplode\n: The theme of the event was inspired by the\nland mine problem in some of the African countries\n. Each team presents a pair of autonomous robots. The first mine-detecting robot maps the arena, and transmits its information regarding the location of the mines to the second robot. The mine-avoiding robot attempts to reach the goal in the shortest time while it avoids the mines.\nXtension\n: The robots coordinate amongst themselves to traverse a series of chasms. There was no restriction on the number of robots one could build, but at least one robot must be autonomous.\n8MileX\n: The autonomous robots travel outdoors on an actual road and follow traffic rules. It is similar to the Robotix 2009 8 Mile event, and is a scaled down version of the\nDARPA Grand Challenge\n.\nTribotX Championship\n: A three-tier tournament that required participants to use their manually-controlled robots to perform three tasks over three days of the festival. The teams with the highest cumulative scores after the first two tasks advanced to final knockout stage. The tasks were selected from a pool of modules. Contestants were then informed of the day's task 12 hours before the start.\neXplore\n: In the underwater event, the manually-controlled robots dive and release several light weight balls held at different coordinates in a large water tank. The robots then collect the balls that are floating on the surface and bring them to the designed area of the arena called the victory zone.\nXants\n: The programming/online event that is inspired by\nant colonies\nand the principles of\nswarm intelligence\nand\ncollective intelligence\n. In a simulation of an ant colony and several energy packets distributed across the arena, where individual ants cannot sense beyond a certain range, and can only leave a scent trail for other ants to follow, participants had to\ndesign an algorithm to optimize this coordination\nand to procure the energy packets efficiently.\nRobotix 2009\nRobotix 2009 was held from 29 January – 1 February 2009, featuring the following events:\n8 Mile\n: The autonomous battery-powered vehicles traverse the road, and must follow traffic rules from traffic lights to zebra crossings.\n12 Doors Down\n: The autonomous robot is placed in a labyrinth of cells. The participants use a manually controlled robot to guide it out of the grid by opening and closing doors.\nMicro Mouse 4D\n: In the programming/online event, participants code a function in a pre-programmed template to run a simulation to address the\nmicro-mouse\nrobotics problem.

It was a one-on-one competition.\n#mEsh\n: The manually controlled robot climbs up and down an inclined metallic mesh. The size of a unit square of mesh is 7 cm x 7 cm.\nRobo-Relay\n: ??\nRobotix 2008\nRobotix 2008 was held from 31 January – 3 February 2008. It featured the following events, two of which were not disclosed beforehand:\nI.M.A.G.E.\n[\nexpand acronym\n]\n: A autonomous robot, with the help of maximum two cameras, navigates the arena while avoiding obstacles, in order to pass various checkpoints and reach the end point.\nRobo-Relay: Two autonomous robots traverse an irregular track while carrying a baton. The robots are synchronized so that they pass the baton and run one after the other.\nOn Spot Robotics (Autonomous): This was an undisclosed event where the participants build an autonomous robot that only uses logic gate circuits (i.e. no microcontrollers).\nStackistics: The manually controlled robot assembles blocks of various pre-specified shapes and sizes to form a given spatial structure.\nTerra Ranger: The manually controlled robot travels on varied land terrains and also water surfaces.\nOn Spot robotics (Manual): This was an undisclosed event where the task was to build a manually controlled robot and controller to fulfill the requirement of the problem statement.\nMission Mars: In the programming event, the participants code robot ants which coordinate among themselves during their mission to explore an area.\nRobotix 2007\nRobotix 2007 was held from 1–4 February 2007. It featured the following events:\nRail Track Inspector\n: The automated robot follows two parallel white lines, 5 cm apart, on a black blackground, and reports any errors it encounters. The errors were of two types. First, it reports when the distance between the lines is different from their specified gap. Second, it reports if either of the white lines are discontinuous. The errors must be classified separately.\nGrid Navigator\n: The autonomous robots move in an 8-foot square maze and detect the positions of obstacles placed in the maze without dislocating them. The maze is in the form of a two dimensional numbered grid. Squares are marked with white lines on a black background. The robot starts in  one corner of the maze and exits on the diagonally-opposite corner after identifying all the obstacles. The robot is free to roam in the grid in any given way.\nMission Mars\n: A repeat of the previous year's event. In this programming/online event, the participants write code to control robot ants on a simulated Martian surface, so that it can cover the maximum area in a given time. Multiple instances of the same program were run at the same time, with each instance able to communicate with the others to prevent collisions which would render both robots extinct. The participants were allowed to code in\nC\n,\nC++\nor\nJava\n.\nJigsaw\n: In this programming/online event, the participants write code to solve a jumbled up picture. The picture is broken into fragments and is scrambled by using a program. Only the top left corner of the jumbled picture is the same as the original picture. The participants code in either C or C++.\nLoad runner\n: The manually controlled robot uses a hooking mechanism to attach freights and link them together to form a train. It then has to act as  the engine of the same train and pull it to its destination. Use of magnetic material to attach to the freights is prohibited.\nStep climber\n: The manually controlled robot climbs up and down a flight of stairs. The height of the steps varies.\nRobotix 2006\nRobotix 2006 was held from 2–5 February 2006. It featured the following events:\nDistance Tracker\n: The autonomous robot travels a certain path and reports the distance traversed in a digital format. The paths varied from a simple circle to an arbitrary route.\nMatch Maker\n: The autonomous robot moves white blocks placed in the arena to regions of their corresponding shape.\nMission Mars\n: In the programming/online event, participants code robot ants to cover as much area of the Martian surface within a given time.\nTop-sy Turvy\n: The manually controlled robot takes balls at different heights and surfaces, and throw thems in a goal post within a limited time.\nWater Polo\n: The manually controlled robot races on a water surface to place five balls inside a certain goal post in the fastest time.\nSee Also\nList of Societies and Clubs\nList of student run research groups\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics\nKshitij\nReferences\n↑\nVerified\nby\nAbhinavjain\non 2015-05-15.\n↑\n\"Events\"\n.\nRobotix Technology Robot Society\n.

        "url": "https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Competitive_Programming",
        "title": "Competitive Programming",
        "content": "This article has been originally written during the winter of 2019-2020. While there are many articles and resources on the internet on \"How to start with competitive programming\", this has been written keeping in mind some of the dynamics of IIT Kharagpur, and to save students from\nParadox of Choice\n.\nWhy Competitive Programming?\nDid you like solving hard math problems, or olympiad problems in your high school? If that's so then chances are that you will like Competitive Programming too. While there are a few benefits from competitive programming, like getting noticed by recruiters and enhancing your problem solving skills, for many it is a hobby to many who like to feel the spirit of a problem solving competitions and the adrenaline rush that comes with it.\nInstead of writing the whole article from scratch, I will just attach the necessary, and sufficient resources needed.\nResources in KGP\nI'm amazed at the number of anynomous queries, on fundae page, saying that KGP lacks resources for Competitive Programming. I guess, for some reason the resource are not well known. So let's list all of them, once and for all.\nWhatsapp group : Yeah there exists quite active Whatsapp group for Competitive Programming.\nWhatsapp Invite for CP Interview Group.\n: Do not join the latter group, if you're preparing for interviews, as the discussion most of the time is on topics not needed for interviews.\nWhatsapp Invite for Regular CP'ers\n- link broken\nCodeX IIT Kharagpur Fb Group\n: If you have any doubt, or even if you want help with debugging. If you're posting your question correctly, there are (100 - e)% chances that it will get resolved. (e is infinitesimal)\nCP Mentor-Mentee Program\nGrimoire of Code\n: Competitive Programming Society of IIT Kharagpur. Also posts interesting problems every other day.\nCompetitve Programming Workshop\nby Codeclub.\n2021\nCompetitive programing workshop videos\nby\nGrimore of Code\n. Div-1, Div-2, Div-3 seperate playlists.\nBasic Information\nProblem Solving\nThere are lot of programming websites where you can practice competitive programming.  Almost all of them follow the same format, where you are given a problem, and you have to write and submit code that will solve the problem. Your solution will be checked on some test cases and you'll be given a verdict depending on, if your program outputs to all the test cases correctly, or not, or if it ends up having a segmentation fault.\nProgramming Websites\nSpoj\n: Spoj is a problem archive. It has many easy problems to help you, if you are just starting with competitive programming. You can sort the problems by number of submissions, and solve first few  (say 25 or 30 or 50) problems. The problem with Spoj is that, after sometime you will find it boring because problems here are repititive, and finding good problems is difficult here. This is the website where you can find the classical problem (problem that asks you to directly implement a standard algorithm or trick) for any algorithm.\nCodechef\n: If you're just begining with competitive programming, you can right away start with Codechef's. It holds atleast three contests a month. The best thing about codechef is its Long challenges, which are aimed for beginners. Each long challenge starts on first friday of every month and lasts for 10 days, and therefore you get enough time to think about problems, debug the codes, and search the internet to learn related things. It also hosts two short contests, Codechef Cook off, and Codechef Lunchtime. Lunchtime consists of more mathematical and ad-hoc problems.\nCodeforces\n: This is the most used competitive programming website. It has a lot of features, including problem ratings, virtual contests, gym, mashups, and better problems. It hosts 5-6 short contests every month. Once you are familiar with problem solving on codechef, start solving problems on codeforces too. Start participating in contests here, once you gain some confidence. Comparing to interview problems, almost no interview problem is harder than Codeforces Div2D.\nAtcoder\n: It holds contests quite irregualry, but the quality of problems is far better than any of the other programming platform. Start solving problems here, once you are comfortable with codeforces problems, and wants to improve your problem solving skills.\nInterviewbit\n: This website contains minimal problems to get you acquainted through Competitive Programming needed to crack interviews, if you are short on time. Once you are familiar with basics needed for Competitive Programming, and want to prepare for interviews, this is the place you should head to.  Even if you are already too good at Competitive Programming, I would suggest you to solve interviewbit to get a taste of problems that are asked in interview.\nLeetCode\n: If you want to solve more interview-related problems on some specific topics other than the ones on interviewbit, then LeetCode covers that for you. It contains a lot of problems that were asked in previous interviews of companies.\nRoadMap\nLearn Basic syntax\nLearn the basic syntax of any programming language until loops, functions, recursion, struct. You can choose any programming language to begin with, java, python, C, C++. This article will mainly focus on C++, as it is used by most competitive programmers.\nC++ is superset of C. If you haven't learnt C yet, then you can directly start with C++.\nC Video Playlist Hindi\n,\nC Video Playlist English\n,\nC slides\nYou do not need to learn classes and their properties in C++ for competitive programming. The part of C++ that makes it far more usable than C in CP is the vast variety of contains and algorithms in Standard Template Library. But before moving to that, just learn input output syntax in C++, and most of the rest is almost same as C\nWhat now?\nThe first thing you should do before you start solving problems is to learn about\nTime and Space Complexity\n. It's always a good idea to calculate the time complexity of your algorithms before you start implementing it. A rule of thumb is that 10^7 operations can pass in 1 second on any programming judge, but if you're not using any of the costly operations like modulo, and overhead of your program is less, then 10^8 operations may pass too.\nNow you're all set to solve problems. Go through this well-written\narticle\nby Triveni Mahata, and try to solve almost all problems from it.\nIf you want to learn some algorithm or some topic, you can find a list of tutorials here\nCodeMonk Hackerearth\nInterview Preparation\nIf you've solved most of the problems in the above article, then you already have had a taste of competitive programming problems, and know about basic uses of STL.\nIf you want to prepare for Interviews, this should be enough to get you going through most of the problems on interviewbit. Directly start solving problems from interviewbit, but make sure to finish almost all problems in the above article before that. Once you're done with interviewbit, you can move on to LeetCode for further practice, and I'm pretty sure, that it is enough for cracking almost all interviews.\nThe article further focuses on, how to improve further in Competitive Programming. If your sole aim is to prepare for interview, you can still practice more problems on codeforces  but that is not necessary at all.\nPlease make sure you check out the\nInterview Blogs Archive\nby CodeClub, IITKGP\nImproving beyond basics\nSo now, you've already solved enough problems from the blog, and you really liked solving problems. But the problem is that you still get stuck at solving even easy problems.\nLearn more algorithms and techniques from\nPrepare Codechef\n's Advanced section.\nDo not stop participating in long challenges and other codechef contests just because you are learning new topics. This ideology, almost never ends well.\nYou can find tutorials to almost all algorithms and data structures at\nCP-agorithms\n.\nStart participating in codeforces contests too.\nIf even after solving so many problems, you still can't get Div2C AC during contest time. Do not worry, we all have been there.\nStart solving problems from\nDiv2 C Ladder\n.\nOnce you are comfortable with problems from Div2C Ladder and you're able to solve most of them without much effort. Start solving\nDiv2D ladder\n.\nIf you've solved most (around 50) problems of Div2D Ladder, and you're still not improving, then do not worry. Let me assure you that you're too close to rating 1800-1900. It is just a matter of time. Keep solving.\nBeyond 1800\nA lot of people in KGP are stuck at around 1800 rating on codeforces. Once you reach the 1800 bar, you know almost all there is to know to reach 2100. The only thing that you need to train now is your problem solving skills. While the gap in rating is just 300 points, it is certainly more hard than getting to 1800 from 1500.\nAnd as I have experienced over time, only people who have been doing competititve programming regularly, and participating in atleast every other contest, have been able to reach 1900 and manage it for a couple of contests.\nWhat problems to solve?\nJust solving contest problems regularly will keep you busy. If you still get time, then there are a whole lot of problems on Codeforces, just filter them by your current rating + 100, and keep solving. Here are some other resource to solve problems.\nCodeforces Ladders by Rating\nAtcoder CheckList\nIOI CheckList\n: If you want to solve some good quality ad-hoc problems, then solve the problems in USACO checklist at the bottom.\nCodeforces Mahsups\n: You can add the problems you want from codeforces and create a mashup contest.\nVjudge\n: Here you can give your customised virtual contest with problems from different judges.\nMore Resources\nCP Resources\n: Contains resources for some advanced algorithms and data structures.\nCP FuckUps\n: Contains non-trivial behaviour, or errors. If  you too find some non-trivial error while solving problem, send a pull request.\nAlgorithms Resources\n: Contains some materials for purists to go through. Old classics still seem pertinent in most cases.\nPiece of Advice\nChecking for correctness of your algorithm is not necessary, but is highly recommended. It not only helps you in figuring out the corner cases, but also in getting more insight into the problem. And, I'm pretty sure if people knew that this ability grows so quickly over time, more people would be doing it.\nDunning-Kruger Effect\n, and the fact that it applies to Competitive Programming so well, is my favourite thing to talk about.\nThe origin is the point, when you start Competitive Programming, and find it so hard, that you may take hours, and sometimes days to debug your code. Everything seems so new, every problems seems to use a different algorithm, and you feel like you do not have talent needed to excel in CP. But as soon as you solve enough problems, you start observing the patterns, and you realise that most problems are just ad-hocs, using some trivial data-structures.\nThe peak point is when you are rated 1700-1800 on codeforces. You think that you know all there is to know, and that you rating doesn't represent your true level. Your rating is low just because you miss some problems in contests during the last minute, or you couldn't debug it before the contest ended. No Karen, your rating represents your true level, if you think that it doesn't then increase your rating. Numbers don't lie.\nThe minima comes when you're just on the boundary of purple and blue. You are afraid to give any contest because that might decrease your rating. So you avoid participating, because you think that you do not deserve to be purple, it is just purely by chance. Participate in contests. Even if you lose rating in a few contests, you will gain it back. You deserved it :)\nDon't fall prey for Dunning-Kruger Effect :)\nImprove your implementation skills. Be time efficient in short contests, have clear thought process.Upsolving is the most important. Make sure you have breadth knowledge of theory. DO NOT focus more on rating (be patient :)). Learn several DS,ALGO to take a deep dive into CP.\nFAQs\nI am not able to improve even after solving a lot of problems. What should I do now?\nChances are that you are solving only easier problems, until you start solving problems that are outside your comfort zone chances are high that you will not improve. Or, it might be the case that you're only under the impression that you're solving problems, while most of the time you're just scrolling through codeforces blogs, and choosing a problem. In that case, see the number, for they never lie :) . How many problems did you solve in the last month? 20 is not a good answer, if you're saying that you're practicing regularly. But I must mention that even if you're solving a lot of problems, and that too outside your comfort zone, you may not see any improvement. In that case keep patience.\nmy cf-rating graph\nEventhough I was practicing a lot during my third semester, I was stuck in between cyan and blue (mostly on the cyan side :( ), but soon after I had a steep curve, which I did not expect at all. These times come with lots of demotivation and self-disappointment but that's how it works, you cannot improve in a day. You have to give it time.\nHow much time should I spend on a problem?\nMy advice is to spend time on a problem as long as you find it interesting. It's only when you start finding it boring, go for the editorial.\nWe want to build this FAQs section. So, if you have any other questions that you want me to answer, then feel free to ping me on\nfacebook\n.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Competitive_Programming&oldid=239695\n\""

Prof. Sourav Mukhopadhyay is a genuinely helpful professor, who has no qualms in repeating each topic multiple times till one understands it. Final opinion - Take this course as an additional only if you want to get done with the least effort put in. Otherwise, would recommend Algorithms-I any day.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nMost questions in the mid-semesters and end-semesters are repeated from previous year papers, so having a look at those is recommended. Some questions are asked from the MIT-OCW assignment questions too\nClassroom resources\nThe teaching style is eerily similar to the course offered by Stanford, while slides are exactly the same. Any standard DS Algo book will do, eg: Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.\nAdditional Resources\nPractice solving problems on online platforms such as Codechef, Hackerrank, Leetcode, InterviewBit to get a good grip on the subject.\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nNR312\nTuesday\nWednesday\nNR312\nNR312\nThursday\nFriday\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=MA30207:_Design_And_Analysis_Of_Algorithms&oldid=229565\n\""

The society aims at spreading diverse music genres, nurturing and motivating musicians, inculcating values and expression through music, and develop good music taste among our audience.\nFunctioning\nSelection Procedure\nWTMS selection auditions are held at least once in a year, in the autumn semester (sometimes happen in the spring semester too, depending on requirement), for all students (UG/PG), around the month of August/September. Selection procedure generally consist of two rounds, where the first round is a preliminary screening round to assess basic musical ability, comfort with the instrument (or singing), basic knowledge, and screened candidates are invited to give a second round of auditions where they are given few (2-3) songs to prepare. For instrumentalists, the songs that are decided are generally same for everyone, and they are chosen such that they cover a diverse spectrum of techniques/skills in the particular instrument, and for vocalists, the songs are given on the basis of the pitch range and the singer's tonality. There is generally a gap of 3-4 days between both rounds of the auditions.\nOrganizational Structure\nWTMS has three governors selected by the society seniors every year who govern the society and represent it in Gymkhana. Overall co-ordination during practices, productions and competitions are handled by the governors.\nActivities\nThe primary activities of the society include organizing and performing two productions every academic year, one in the Autumn Semester and the other in Spring Semester. The playlist is decided few weeks prior to the production through a consensus of all the members in the society. Songs are chosen so that the playlist is as diverse as possible, consisting of (but not limited to) genres such as Rock (Progressive/Post/Classic/Psychadelic), Metal(Thrash/Prog/Core), Jazz, Blues, Funk, Neo-soul, R&B.\nAutumn Production\nWTMS performs the annual production in the autumn semester generally in the month of October/November around the Durga Puja vacations. This is also the first time the new inductees get the chance to perform for the society.\nSpring Production\nWTMS performs the spring production in the spring semester generally in the month of March, after the end-semester examinations, around the time when Hall Days are going on. This happens to be the final production of the graduating batch and they get a chance to play some of their favourite songs for one last time in KGP.\nGovernors\nList of Governors\n2019-20\nNishok Sundarresan\nRiazuddin Khan\n-\n2018-19\nBhushan Deshmukh\nUtkarsh Tyagi\nHaripriyo Mondal\n2017-18\nKushal Gaikwad\nAbhinav Jain\nSouvik Bhattacharya\n2016-17\nNishant Kumar\nJainil Yadav\nShambhobi Bhattacharya\n2015-16\nVinay Bhaskar\nDikshant Raj\nSatyaki Das\n2014-15\nArmaan Hatwal\nAkash Gupta\nSoham Goswami\n2013-14\nAritra Basu\nKoulick Ghosh\nSumit Mohanty\n2012-13\nPraful Puranik\nSaakallya Biswas\nSayan Pramanik\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Western_Technology_Music_Society&oldid=239442\n\""

        "content": "Student Welfare Group, IIT Kharagpur\nFile:KgpSWG logo.jpg\nFounded\n2011\n(\n2011\n)\nFounder(s)\nAnmol Chopra, Rahul Agrawal\nNumber of members\n30\nWebsite\nswgiitkgp\n.org\nContact\n+91 8016761358 (Akash Verma)\n+91 9126147522 (Amit Anand)\n+91 8436241925 (Nikhil Kedia)\n+91 9564365113 (Sourav Basu)\nUnder\nTSG\nYES\nThe\nStudent Welfare Group\n(SWG) is a student body under the office of the Dean of Students’ Affairs, IIT Kharagpur\n.\nIt strives to be with those who need help and promises to sweat for the realization and solutions of issues faced by our fellow mates. It is an organization of the students, for the students, by the students. It functions as two teams:\nThe Central Team\nThe Hall Coordinators Team\nHistory\nThe Counselling Centre was set up in 2009 by the Dean Of Students′ Affairs, IIT Kharagpur as an outcome of his efforts to make the campus a better campus for the entire student community.\nIt provided the students a place where they could easily approach with a problem and leave with a solution. The reach of the Counselling Centre was further extended through the Hall Coordinators Team. However, the increasing strength of students in the campus called for active participation from the students themselves in this cause. This was the scenario which saw the establishment of the Student Welfare Group in August 2011.\nStudent Welfare Group was initially an idea that evolved out of a feeling to perpetuate and nurture a campus life which is hassle-free. Today, it is a dedicated group of students willing to sort out various issues of concern for the students. It plans to emerge as a more successful organization with more activities managed and implemented for the welfare of students.\nVision\nThe aim of SWG is to ensure that every student's life in KGP is hassle free so that they can achieve their potential zenith while their stay in KGP as well as in their professional career. SWG aims to instil a belief in every student that they can achieve all their goals in life. SWG assists students in resolving their difficulties in every field, be it academic or extra-academic & curricular or co-curricular. It aims to create and sustain an environment that promotes personal growth and discovery, the pursuit of healthy minds and bodies, and participation in the creation of a caring community.\nEvents and programmes\nStudent Mentorship Programme\nThis programme involves the guidance and mentorship of every single first year student by a 3rd or 4th year student of the same department. The objective of this programme is to help the first years understand the various aspects of college life, and adapt accordingly. This programme ensures that the hindsight of the Mentor becomes the foresight of the Mentee. The Mentees can benefit immensely from the insight of the Mentor and find the best possible way to utilize their time in the campus. The Student Mentor Programme provides scope for constructive and productive interaction between the freshmen and the experienced seniors, which forms an integral part of college life.\nPDS Doubt Sessions\nAn interactive session organized by the SWG for those who feel like they are lagging behind in the course because of no prior knowledge.\nProgramming and Data Structures\nis an important course of the first year curricula. The instructors are senior students of the institute who try to increase the problem tackling capability of the students, starting from the very basic level and build up their confidence to face the competition. In Friday’s sessions, tutorial sheets are provided to the students and the tutors help them to solve the questions by clearing the doubts of each and every student. In Sunday’s sessions, students are supposed to come with their laptops and they are given a set of programming questions like the ones given in PDS Laboratory classes. The tutors help the students in coding, compiling and running their programs. At the end of the sessions, the instructors also provide printed solution of the tutorial sheet to the students.\nGD/PI Sessions\nStudent Welfare Group in association with Smart Training Institute, a renowned organization for grooming and perfecting\nsoft skills\n, presents an opportunity to boost students' performance at group discussions and personal interviews just as the season for internships and placements begins. The workshop has been a success in the past with most of the students giving positive feedback. Since the collaboration with the private institute is in its early phase, there is a lot of room and scope in future. Taking into consideration the feedback, the SWG aims to provide better workshops in the following sessions.\nPanel Discussion (Wings Of Fire)\nStudent Welfare Group organised a Panel Discussion by the batch of 2010-11. It invited students to open up to the valuable experience shared by the panelists in a discussion encompassing every facet of KGP life, including academics, extracurriculars, sports, societies and PORs. This discussion was very helpful for freshers who had just joined the institute. Panelists shared their vast experience of 4-5 years in KGP. Apart from freshers, a large number of 2nd and 3rd year students also gathered for this panel discussion.\nForeSight\nSWG\npresents\nForeSight\n, a program which provides the campus students a unique interface to connect with the people who have mastered their field and hence get a foresight of their future. It will cover various career related dimensions (placements, internships, FTs, competitions) from the students of the campus as well as alumni of the institute.\nThe Campus Tour\nA campus ride is being organized to acquaint freshers about the important places of the campus that a student needs to know. It begins from Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur (TSG). In 2015, more than 1200 freshers in 28 separate buses were shown the magnificence of the KGP campus with engaging interactions of SWG team with freshers.\nInformation Brochure- A Walk Through\nFor the first time in the history of our campus, printed version of Institute Information Brochure was circulated among all the freshers, thanks to the rigorous efforts of the SWG team and support of the administration. We hope it has helped the freshers batch a lot in their initial days here at KGP.\nISSUE\n[\n1\n]\nElectrical/Mechanics Doubt Sessions\nStudent Welfare Group is proud to announce Electrical and Mechanics Doubt Sessions for the first year UG students with the help of the Vice President, TSG and the faculty of Electrical Technology and Mechanics. The schedule of the doubt sessions is as follows:\nEvery Saturday\nstarting from 29th August, 2015.\nHall Coordinators Programme\nStudent Welfare Group conducts the Hall Coordinators Programme with the help of Hall Coordinators' Team that would work directly with the Counselling Centre for the overall well-being of the fellow peers and thus ensure 'A Hassle-free Kgp Life' !\nKGP Blood Connect\nKharagpur Blood Connect, an initiative of Student Welfare Group (SWG) IIT Kharagpur and Gopali Youth Welfare Society, established to serve the same purpose, is always there to help you in making your contribution, as \"To the young and healthy it’s no loss. To sick it’s hope of life. Donate Blood to give back life.\" It is an endeavour of ensuring that no one on campus struggles to find a blood donor in times of need!\nPublic Speaking Forum\nSWG has come with Public Speaking Forum , a platform which'll make you aptly equipped to fight the fear of Public Speaking. This is an 8 session long program. The initiative mainly concentrates on the individuals with a basic knowledge of English language however speaking on a public platform bothers them which can prove to be a hindrance in realizing their future endeavors.\nGovernors and Heads\n2024 - 25\nAdvisors\nAnish Behuray\nJainish Solanki\nKhushi Agrawal\nPriyanshi Khetan\nShubham Singh\nYash Kumar\nJSR Sujit\nNikhitha Sapharu\nExecutive Heads\nShashank Tiwari\nAstha Kumari\nHeads\nAkshat Kapoor\nShravan Barad\nBhawesh Kukreja\nVumika Ghosh\nShivam Bisen\nAstitva Srivastava\n2023 - 24\nAdvisors\nRithick Prabakar\nDhruv Rathi\nBishal Kumar Behera\nAditi Ujjain\nLalam Hari Prasad\nMd Zaid Alam\nPratik Choudhury\nSneha Majumder\nKeval Mehta\nHimadri Pandya\nAbhishek\nExecutive Heads\nJSR Sujit\nNikhitha Sapharu\nHeads\nAnish Behuray\nJainish Solanki\nKhushi Agrawal\nPriyanshi Khetan\nShubham Singh\nYash Kumar\n2022-23\nAdvisors\nDevesh Gobind\nTanaya Ramane\nSwagat Kumar Panda\nSreeya Chillapuri\nWaqaar Hussain\nAwais Akhtar\nSri Harika Reddy\nYathartha Soneji\nVedant Vani\nJeripothula Sindhu\nBhosale Shivam Pravin\nExecutive Heads\nHimadri Pandya\nAbhishek\nHeads\nRithick Prabakar\nDhruv Rathi\nBishal Kumar Behera\nAditi Ujjain\nLalam Hari Prasad\nKeval Mehta\nMd Zaid Alam\nPratik Choudhury\nSneha Majumder\n2021-22\nAdvisors\nKunal Das\nLavish Singhal\nTapasya Pratap Singh\nDevang Upadhyaya\nAditi Singhania\nNikhil Kumar\nAnimesh Jha\nPrachi Kharparde\nAkash Dusane\nExecutive Heads\nJeripothula Sindhu\nBhosale Shivam Pravin\nHeads\nDevesh Gobind\nTanaya Ramane\nSwagat Kumar Panda\nSreeya Chillapuri\nWaqaar Hussain\nAwais Akhtar\nSri Harika Reddy\nYathartha Soneji\nVedant Vani\nGovernors and Heads\n2019-20\nGovernors\nAkshat Jain\nAnju Joon\nLakshya Agrawal\nNishchal Baghele\nAdvisors\nRajat Goel\nHeads\nAnshul Agarwal\nKunal Das\nLavish Singhal\nMrityunjay Mehta\nRitam Talukder\nShivam Bhatia\nTapasya Pratap Singh\n2018-19\nGovernors\nUtkarsh Kumar\nPushpendra Singh Rathore\nPriyang Mani Tripathi\nAamol Lohani\nAdvisors\nDileep Shukla\nTYSS Santosh\nSaurabh Chandra Pandey\nHeads\nRajat Goel\nPrateek Manikpuri\nAkshat Jain\nAnju Joon\nLakshya Agrawal\nNishchal Baghele\nRajdeep Singh\nYograj Sirohi\n2017-18\nGovernors\nNihal Gupta\nVaibhav Agrawal\nRaju Bhakar\nAdvisors\nShashwat Mishra\nPrasanna Dange\nHeads\nUtkarsh Kumar\nPushpendra Singh Rathore\nAamol Lohani\nDileep Shukla\nPriyang Mani Tripathi\nTYSS Santosh\nSaurabh Chandra Pandey\n2016-17\nGovernors\nAmey Muley\nAkash Khandelwal\nKaran Gupta\nAdvisors\nTushar Gupta\nAshutosh Yadav\nManoj Meena\nSiddhant Jain\nSanket Modi\nHeads\nRaju Bhakar\nPrasanna Dange\nAnkur Ankit\nSurendra Puri\nShashwat Mishra\nNihal Gupta\nVaibhav Agrawal\nZain Ahmad\nVeda Vyshnavi\nPranitha Sriramoju\n2015-16\nGovernors\nAkash Verma\nAmit Anand\nNikhil Kedia\nSourav Basu\nAdvisors\nSheenal Chhabra\nAbhishek Chakraborty\nNishant Agarwal\nShankar Basava\nUma Ravali\nAnkit Bansal\nShyam Simaria\nHeads\nManoj Meena\nPrithvi Krishna\nKunwarvir Singh\nAkash Khandelwal\nChahak Tharani\nRavina Moirangthem\nAshutosh Yadav\nTushar Gupta\nKaran Gupta\nIshan Jain\nSiddhant Jain\nSanket Modi\nAmey Muley\n2014-15\nGovernors\nAbhishek Chaudhary\nNishchay Dayal\nHeads\nAkash Verma\nAmit Anand\nNikhil Kedia\nSourav Basu\nSheenal Chhabra\nAbhishek Chakraborty\nNishant Agarwal\nShankar Basava\nUma Ravali\nAnkit Bansal\nShyam Simaria\nReferences\n↑\nhttp://issuu.com/studentwelfaregroup/docs/ug_information_brochure\nExternal Links\nhttps://student-welfare-group.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SWGIITKGP\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swg.swg_app&hl=en_IN&gl=US&pli=1\nhttps://medium.com/@swgiitkgp\nhttps://www.instagram.com/swg.iit_kgp/\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Student_Welfare_Group&oldid=238341\n\""

Lubrication of joints. Motion and gait analysis – method, gait cycle, segmental kinetics, engineering approaches to posture analysis. Joint replacement and fracture fixation – stress analysis and basic design approach, failure mechanisms, wear in joint arthroplasty, bone remodelling, biomaterials – properties and application.\nConcepts taught in class\nMechanics of Human Body is a subject that applies the concepts mechanical engineering to the human body. We start with the presumption that the human body is a machine with links, joints and actuators. The course topics till mid-semester include:\nTypes of joints\nSynovial\nCartilaginous\nFibrous\nMuscles and Tendons\nJoints:\nKnee\nShoulder\nElbow\nHip\nThere is also elaborate discussion on prosthetics, sports biomechanics.\nStudent Opinion\nThis is an extremely interesting subject, the lectures are short, non-boring, and icky(when he tells you about the different ways to tear ligaments). Also, you'll get to play with fibre replicas of different joints and bones.\nFun trivia:\nThere're ligaments in the knee called anterior and posterior cruciate(like \"cruciatus\") ligaments, which have a role in the osteoarthritis pain\nMost of the joints in our body are unstable, such as the shoulder/glenohumeral joint, and can displace with little disruption.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nPractice previous years' questions papers, over 80% is repeated verbatim.\nFor shoulder/knee/elbow/hip, remember the following\nmuscles, ligaments,tendons and bones\nnames and types of all joints\ndegrees of freedom\nClassroom resources\nAll classroom resources are updated on Google Drive and shared by the professor.\nSuggested reference books\nNordin & Frankel\nAdditional Resources\n↑\n1.0\n1.1\nVerified\nby\nAngry Bitch\non 2016-02-16.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=ME30640:_Mechanics_Of_Human_Body&oldid=15812\n\""

        "content": "(This page was compiled by Ankur Agarwal (EX '17), Vivek Aithal (AE '16) and Kunal Jain (IM '17))\nDecember can be a harrowing time for final year students who enroll themselves for the placement process. This wiki is an effort to compile the best practices and resources that helped students get job offers, in various sectors. Each section contains answers to the following questions by successful candidates.\nWhat was the general interview process for most companies of this sector?

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.\nCase Interview + Behavioural/ Experience Interview\n​(The second one I'd say is a little different from the regular HR interviews- the focus is upon your learnings and getting to know you more personally, things which aren't on resume, something which might be there in your SOP)​\nCompany:\nBCG\nNumber of rounds:​\n4 in-person\nThe first 2 rounds were guesstimates with extrapolated case questions, i.e. candidate is expected to give some inference with respect to the number obtained.\nGuesstimate 1:\nSize of pre-schools in India\nGuesstimate 2:\nAnnual revenue of one BCG India office\nThe next 2 rounds were strategic and subjective case questions with no numbers involved.​\nCandidate is expected to go about addressing the case in a structured manner. It's more than possible that one may miss a few points, and the interviewer will also be cool with it as long as the approach is structured. The guessing game is fragile and easily gets caught. Moreover, the interviewer would never help and instead would prod more if he/ she realizes that random arrows are being shot wildly in the sky. The last round (Partner round) was Data Interpretation in my case from the regular consult slides (something similar to the Capital One test)- familiarity with DI would hence certainly help.\nA candid and cheerful approach is very very helpful. Afterall, these companies want individuals with whom they want to work with. Having said that, there is a very thin line between candid and cocky (excuse for the language). Do bear that in mind.\nWhat are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for?\nTell me something about yourself. Walk me through your resume. Resume grilling.\nThe most challenging environment/ work etc.\nWhy consulting? Why the firm? Why you?\nThis could be a long list and can be googled up as well. The idea is to sell yourself in all/ most of the answers.\nResources\nMust do resources [Compulsory reads]\nCase in Point -  Marc P.

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.\nConsulting companies primarily gauge how “client safe” you are. One’s case solving acumen is tested apart from how comfortably you can interact with the interviewer and strike up a conversation with him/her. For consulting companies the interview is preceded by a buddy session wherein each shortlisted student is assigned a buddy (a person working at the firm). The buddy aids you in your preparation (feel free to ask him/her all your doubts and practice as many cases as possible with your buddy).In some companies the buddy process is evaluative.\nThere are mainly 2 components to an interview: Case and HR. The case given to you will be a real life case that your interviewer has worked on. Always remember the interviewer is just assessing your thinking process. The answer isn’t too important to him. Also, it’s really important to be good with numbers for quantitative cases. Since we are from an engineering background, a lot of focus is given to numbers cases by the companies. In the HR component you are asked questions on your resume. The interviewer is mainly interested in what you have learnt from a particular experience or the impact you were able to create etc. They generally don’t get into the technical aspects of your internships.\nYou can expect atleast one case (or guesstimate) derived from your own personal experiences. This is normally asked to assess how well you can apply knowledge gained through your own experiences to a case. Eg. I stay in Bombay so I was asked to estimate the amount of toll collected on the Bandra-Worli Sealink in a day.\nYou can expect anywhere between 3-6 rounds depending on the company. The final interview rounds are with the partners of the firm.\nWhat are things students can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector.?\nThe first stage in applying to a consulting company is submission of your CV and cover letter. So in the vacations you can focus on making your CV. Consulting companies are looking for candidates with a spike in their profile (it can be in sports, PORs, internships, cultural activities, etc.) along with a good academic record. Students can start case prep from August and HR prep around 10 days before the interview. Also, you should be absolutely thorough with your resume.\nThe main focus of students should be on case solving. It is highly recommended that students form case groups among themselves (I’d recommend 3 students in one case group). I’ve generally observed that how students perform in an interview depends on the combined efforts of the entire group and coordination in the group. It’s your entire case group that’s going to correct your mistakes and help you prepare for the interview and not just the individual efforts put in by you. So make sure you choose your case group wisely.\nNext for case prep, students should start with the Victor Cheng videos and then move on to the IIT Bombay casebook. Other sources that can be referred to after this are: IIM-A casebook, ISB casebook, Case in Point, Kellogg Casebook and HBS Casebook.\nYour focus should not be on solving a huge number of cases. It’s not the quantity of cases you’ve solved that matters but the quality of your preparation that makes the difference. Also, try to solve as many cases as possible with people in the consulting industry and not just your buddies. The feedback you get from them goes a long way in helping you prepare.\nIt’s important you develop a systematic thinking process while solving cases. MECE (Mutually exclusive and completely exhaustive) is one such technique. You will come across a lot of frameworks to solve cases during your preparation. My suggestion is to come up with your own case framework along with your case group. That really helped me in my interviews. Coming up with your own framework is a slow and steady process. As you keep solving cases and come across different frameworks, keep building your own framework. I kept refining my framework as I solved more and more cases.\nA frequently asked question is how much focus should be laid on guesstimates. Guesstimates are generally asked in market sizing questions. Students should regularly practice guesstimates as well though not as much as cases.\nResources\nMust do resources: Victor Cheng videos, IIT Bombay Casebook, Buddy Cases/Cases with people working in the consulting sector\nAdditional Resources: IIM-A casebook, ISB casebook, Case in Point, Kellogg Casebook and HBS Casebook, Ambition Box\nM A Krishna Deepak - Placed at BCG\nWhat was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.\nThe interview process involves multiple levels of interviews. The initial rounds can be over telephone, Skype or in person subject to the company's preference. They were all case interviews - designed to test our basic business case/problem solving abilities. Some of them might involve a few questions related to HR and they can be particularly detrimental, given Consults' problems tackling high attrition.\nWhat are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for?\nTell me about yourself? Why consulting? Where do you see yourself 5/10 years later? What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses? Mention one of your failures? Questions on being a team player, leader, displaying ownership, creativity and initiatives - CV specific.\nWhat are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector?\nBe extremely good at what you do. Be it Finance, Banking, Consulting, Sports, Academics or Research! Diversify if possible to justify that you are game for consulting given a different background. Work on communication and networking skills. English. In most cases, you don't work towards becoming a consultant, you just get cherry picked because of whatever you're good at.\nResources\nCase Interviews Video Lectures by Victor Cheng, Case Interviews Cracked from IIT Bombay, IIM A casebook\nCase in Point\nInvestment Banking/Finance\nSoftware Development/Coding/Quant\nManav Kedia - Offers from Goldman Sachs, VISA, Microsoft; PPOs from Adobe, Codenation\nWhat was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.\nEach company has its own online test, usually on Hackerrank consisting of 3-4 coding questions and/or MCQ's from Computer Science domain. After you qualify this round and are shortlisted for the interview, usually for all the SDE positions, the general process consists of 2-3 technical rounds followed by 1 HR round. Some companies like Microsoft may even have a group fly round for all of its shortlisted candidates.\nIn the technical rounds, they ask you 2-3 coding questions which you have to code on paper(proper syntax and everything, not pseudo code) and/or domain related questions from DBMS, Networks, OS and ML(if mentioned in the resume).\nIn the HR round they ask you the typical HR questions such as why do you want to join our company, do a SWAT analysis, what are your long term and short term interests. One should also prepare his/her answers for the HR round and not just for the technical rounds.\nWhat are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for?\nPreparing for the typical HR questions is a must in my opinion. Other than that you should have \"introduce yourself\" prepared and oriented to the company position that you are applying to. This was something that almost every interviewer asks before beginning. Another question that they usually ask you is to explain one of the projects that you have worked on with a little detail. Be sure to go through your resume very well and have something prepared for every project/ achievement that you have written on your resume.\nWhat are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector?\nStrengthen your fundamentals in the core CS subjects such as DBMS, ML(if you have mentioned it in your resume), Networks and OS. Practise competitive programming regularly on sites such as codeforces, codechef. Take up projects. Setup a profile on Github, push your projects there.\nResources\ngeeksforgeeks.com (Algorithms and data structures part are a must)\ntopcoder tutorials on advanced topics such as binary indexed trees, suffix arrays, segment trees (important for google)\nDo practise on interviewbit.com, it helps to handle the corner test cases\nAbhijeet Raj - Placed at Goldman Sachs\nWhat was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.\nThere are two types of quant, first one is of the cat format which can be mastered by practicing any of the materials available for CAT exams. The second one is of different kind. It requires you to deal with basic probability, theory of expectation and brain storming. The companies i interviewed for were of the second type. They ask you questions related to probability and expectation numbers. For analytics they check whether you know the basic and business concepts behind all the analytics work you have written in your CV.\nWhat are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for?\nThe most important FAQ is to decide which sector you want to land up into. You should never aim for 200+ companies rather aim for 10 companies based upon your area of interest and start preparing for them. Another important thing to remember is that the placement semester is not for analyzing what you haven't done rather think about what you have done and how can you make that your selling point. If you have an answer for these two questions you are ready for placements\nWhat are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector?\nStudy the basics of probability and statistics. Go through first 4-5 chapters of Jain and Iyengar. Learn the basics of machine learning and practice it by participating in various competitions held online. Try and get an internship in this sector.\nResources\nMust do resources\n1. Hines for probability and statistics.\n2. Intro to machine learning by Andrew NG(Coursera)\n3.

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.\nIt starts with a test comprising of a few MCQs and coding questions before the actual interview, during October-December. Once you clear that, they will usually take 2-3 technical interviews. If you clear one round, you go on to the next. In these interviews, they will ask varied questions from your CV, some technical knowhow and again, more coding questions. The biggest focus is on whether you can find an optimal algorithm to solve the given problem/ implementation, and then code it in a reasonable amount of time.\nWhat are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for?\nThe coding questions are usually from DP or graph theory, and I didn't find a new question being asked. I was asked to implement an LRU cache thrice actually! And definitely brush up on your C++/Java skills - Base class / Super Class / OOP / Abstraction / Encapsulation etc.\nWhat are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector\nCode. Code. Code.\nTake an active interest in competitive programming. Participate in competitions by codechef/hackerrank/topcodef/codeforces. One advice I would give is, even if you can't solve the problem during the contest, go back later and check out the editorial, and then solve it. If you still can't, see the author's / tester's solution and then solve it. By december, you should be able to solve all problems easier than \"Medium\".\nAlso, try finishing of questions in all related domains on hackerrank - Algorithms/C++/Java/Python/Data Structures etc.\nResources\nMust do resources [Compulsory reads]\n- hackerrank domains, geeksforgeeks, careercup, Introduction to Algorithms by Corman/notes by Prof Abhijit Das\nAdvanced resources [They are not required for all companies, but will improve chances in top tier firms]\n- competitive coding on the aforementioned websites; Cracking the Coding Interview\nAuxiliary read [They are not compulsory, but will definitely help]\n- There is a book on competitive coding by Steven Halim, get a hold of it, and try to learn everything from it.\nSrinivasan Sivanandan - Placed at Samsung\nWhat was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.\nFor most of the companies in Software Development sector, there was an online coding test to screen followed by 2-3 rounds of technical and HR interviews. The technical rounds were mostly based on algorithms, machine learning, programming languages, image processing, software development practices and puzzles. The HR round was based on my projects and internships along with the usual why this company? why select you? questions.\nWhat are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for?\nI would recommend students interested in these profiles to have a strong working knowledge of algorithms in atleast one programming language. Machine learning, data science and IP skills with experience in these fields through internships and projects would be an added advantage to crack the interviews. Some HR questions like \"tell me about yourself\", \"strengths & weakness\" are so frequent that the interviewer expects an immediate answer from you. Preparing for those questions well before is advisable.\nWhat are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector?\nTo maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector, students must be well prepared in data structures, dynamic programming and graph theory. With a lot of companies interested in data sciences recently, machine learning and AI knowledge is highly recommended. Students can take up courses(on-campus or through MOOCs) and do internships to gain experience in these areas. Students can try to increase their CGPA if possible as it matters a lot in the selection processes.\nResources\nMust do resources - geeksforgeeks, ambitionbox\nAdvanced resourses - Introduction to Algorithms - Cormen, Probability & Statistics - Hines, Machine Learning - Tom Mitchell\nAuxillary resourses - MOOCs (coursera, udacity, edX)\nGeneral advice to students of all years:\nCGPA is *very* important\nGood Internships and projects can get help you a lot in placements\nHave a goal and be unique in whatever you do in these 4/5 years - Companies look for unique profiles and personalities\nData Analytics\nSahil Grover - Placed at American Express\nInterview Process\nRound 1 - Resume Shortlist\nResume fitting for a data analysis profile are shortlisted. So writing R, Python and programming skills in the CV should help you getting shortlisted. Almost 200 students were shortlisted for the test. Make sure you mention your courses or projects related to data analysis in the resume.\nRound 2 - Test\nDuration: 60 minutes\nNo. of Questions: 20\nThe test was on mettl.com\nIt was a very easy test which judges your quantitative aptitude and logical reasoning (find the next shape, find the missing number). Questions like \"find the least no to be multiplied by 100! such that is its divisible by 3^50?\" , \"find the probability of dice rolled three times to sum up as 10?\".\nPreparing for CAT would do. It is a very easy test. You need you ensure that all your questions are correct as there was a lot of time.\nRound 3 - Technical Interview\nI expected a very technical round with all sorts of questions on statistics and data analysis. But it was soft spoken interview. They literally want to know why you want to join data analysis and Why Amex? And how passionate are you towards work?\nInterview is taken by very experienced people from the company and is more of a discussion about ur cv and projects related to data analysis. They listen to whatever code or piece of programming you have done and how well you know.\nI talked about the courses I took to learn data analysis on coursera, my MTP project on optimization and its algorithms and why i wanted to join Amex.\nMy interview ended with a puzzle which was \"There is weight balance and i want to measure from 1 kg to 100 kg. So what is the minimum no of stones and their weights required to measure any material with weght between 1kg to 100 kg.\". I solved the problem and then he asked me why do you think this is the most optimum way. I answered it a bit and then he made my problem difficult by adding a information that \"we can put weights on both sides\". I was not able to solve it but defined the strategy should be used to find solution. My interview ended with my interviewer helping me solve the problem and explaining me the answers clearly. He said he will talk to HR but no HR round happened and I got selected. I would suggest to check with others about the kind of HR questions they ask.\nInterview Tips\nBe confident, talk about what you know. I started my data analysis in the last semester but was really amazed with the things I studied. So, most important thing is to find out if you like the domain or not. If the domain fits you, its the matter of showing interviewers the enthusiasm towards the subject genuinely. Placement is the matter of the interviewer understanding your motivation to work with the firm. So show them what you got for them.\nKnowing data analysis obviously helps but company expects you learn and grow rather learn in the company from most experienced people itself.\nResources\nHow To Ace The Brain Teaser,\nSkills\nLogical reasoning, Quantitative Aptitude, Statistical Inference, R programming\nFMCG\nStudents with Shorlists/Offers across Multiple Sectors\nVaibhav Goyal - Offers from Goldman Sachs, Shell; shorlists at Deutsche Bank, AB InBev\nWhat was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.\nDB (Finance)\nI am writing this answer from a general point of view of finance companies (DB, CS, JPM). GS was more of a Quant based role. Mostly the first step is a resume based shortlisting followed by a GD (in case of DB, CS) or a written test (in case of JPM) followed by final interviews on DAY 1. For some profiles of CS, there is a quant test (the test is supposed to be tough but I am not really sure as I did not apply for those profiles). I only appeared for the process of DB so I am only going to (qualified to) talk about DB.\nShortly after resume shortlisting, an interactive session is organised by DB. It’s a really good platform to understand the job role and get your queries answered from DB people itself. It is supposed to be a non-evaluative session but I’ll advise people to take it seriously. The GD is more of an interactive session, with a senior member of the management directing the conversation and asking for the views of everyone on a topic. On DAY 1, there will be multiple rounds of interviews for DB. My first round was a technical interview as I had a background in Finance (CFA L1 and IB Internship). For people who do not have a background in finance, first round will be a resume based interview). I was tested on various topics ranging from Corp Fin to FRA from CFA L1 but the majority of my interview was spent on my internship. Second and third rounds were both behavioural interviews with the senior management from DB. Be prepared for questions like Why Finance? Why DB? Why not (insert your major)? Why should we hire you? 3 shortcomings etc.\nGS (Quant)\nAs for GS, the first step is a written test (actually the first step is resume shortlisting but everyone is shortlisted) which comprises of three sections: Quant (Math), Machine Learning & Coding. One does not need to attempt all the sections to be selected for final interviews. I only attempted the Quant section which mainly comprised of questions from basic probability theory. Final interview was also on the same lines with puzzles and questions from basic probability theory. As the interview went on, the difficulty level of the questions kept on increasing but the domain was restricted to probability theory only. I would like to emphasise here that CODING is NOT REQUIRED for selection process of GS although obviously it is a big advantage. I have never written a line of code (except for the 1\nst\nyear PDS course) in my entire life. They are just evaluating your line of thinking and whether you will be able to learn on the job or not.\nShell\n1.    Online application\n2.    Online tests (Part1-20min; Part2-45 min)\n3.    E-Tray exercise before the day of interview: In this exercise you will be given a role in the company and documents of certain project. Then you will be receiving a series of mails from different people in the organization or people related to the project. You have to choose the most suitable answer from 5 given options based on the information provided and assuming the role given to you.)\n4.    Interview\nPart 1: Solving a case-30 min for preparation, 45 min discussion on case;\nPart 2: Series of competency based, situational and behavioural questions to be assessed against the CAR criteria)\nAB Inbev\nThe selection procedure of AB Inbev is a pretty long drawn out process. Starts with online application followed by 2 online tests. One of them is a logical reasoning test while the other one is a behavioural test. Further shortlisting is based on your test results as well as your resume. After this you will have the individual business case round. It's essentially a case study where you have to recommend 2 seasonal beers for the launch based on the given data. You will be asked follow up questions based on your recommendations. I also had a standard HR interview along with the Business Case round. If you clear this, then you'll be invited for the business game round. You'll be divided into teams (with fellow applicants) and will be given certain roles in a company like VP Sales, VP Finance, President etc.. There would be certain objectives listed for the company and together you have to achieve those. It's a really fun game and you'll surely enjoy it. If you clear that, then they will fly you to Shanghai for the final round. The final round is a panel interview with the most senior management of AB Inbev like APAC President, Head Supply, Head HR etc.\nWhat are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for?\nI would advise people to prepare for resume based and HR Questions for companies like DB, Shell, AB Inbev and puzzles for GS. Technical questions mostly depend on the profile of the individual but as a general rule people should be thorough with their resumes and should be able to talk freely about their internships/projects. Questions like Walk me through your resume, Tell me about yourself are a given and should be answered without any problems. HR prep is one of the most underrated parts of placement preparation. You are bound to face HR Questions at some point or the other in the interview whether you are sitting for a technical role like ITC or a management role like Shell or AB-Inbev. But most of the people tend to leave HR prep for too late and hence suffer during the placements. Please do not make the same mistakes.\nWhat are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector?\n1. GS – If you are really sure about going to GS then start reading about probability theory, expectation theory (If you want to go through the Quant route) and try learning coding (It would be a big advantage going into the placement season). But it is not something that can’t be done from July to December.\n2. AB Inbev – Nothing\n3. Shell – Nothing\n4. Finance: Get a good internship in the sector. Most of the people who were shortlisted either had great POR’s or had good internships in this sector. Since you can’t do a lot about the former, try to work on the latter. I believe that one of the major points that differentiated my resume from the rest of the people was my internship. Try to get an internship where you get to work on a live deal (like an IPO or M&A deal). It is a real great talking point in the interviews and would set you apart from the rest. Also, if you are sure about finance as a long term career choice, try to read about certifications like CFA, FRM etc. and see if they will help you further in your career. Do not give CFA blindly just for sake of getting shortlisted. These certifications will definitely help in shortlisting but you will have to defend them in a rigorous interview.\nResources\n1. GS – Heard on the Street, How to move Mount Fuji for puzzles; Prob & Stats lectures available on DC for probability.\n2. AB Inbev – Nothing\n3. Shell – Nothing\n4. Finance: CFA L1 material on Corp Fin, Financial Reporting and Analysis (FRA); Regularly follow financial news from Bloomberg/Reuters/Economic Times; if you are really sure about finance and have nothing better to do, then you can also view lectures from Aswath Damodaran on Corporate Finance (they are available on youtube)\nCore Engineering\nAerospace Engineering\nRishita Das - Placed at Rolls Royce\nWhat was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.\nMost of the Aerospace companies had the following rounds:\n- CV shortlisting (sometimes they would shortlist all),\n-  Technical/Quantitative/Mental Ability/Verbal test round : sometimes (like in case of Airbus) the test was specific to the job profile we applied to and involved purely technical questions of the field.\n- Interview (technical): generally half an hour to 1 hour long. Some companies ask questions from CV and other past experiences while some others focus on conceptual questions from core Aerospace.\n- Interview (HR): They ask questions on acads and extra acads in CV and maybe things you know about their company. They try to analyze your commitment and other attributes they are looking for in your answers. Keeping cool and confident with everything in your CV is the key.\nWhat are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for?\n- At the start of any interview(technical or HR): \"Tell me about yourself\". Keep it short and personal. Don't go with the scripted form of answering this question. This question can give a good first impression.\n- \"Where do you see yourself in 5/10 years?\"\n- If you have a high CGPA, prepare to answer the question- \"What is the guarantee that you won't leave the job and go for higher studies?\" ... Do not go with a cliched answer. Prepare your own and keep it natural and ensure it doesn't sound like a rehearsed one.\nWhat are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector.\n- For Core companies, go through the basic concepts, possible questions and problems/puzzles of your courses of the last few years. Some ask from fundamentals while some interviewers ask from advanced level courses from 3rd or 4th years of study. So prepare both types well. While preparing, its best to do so with at least one friend. Make an approximate schedule/timetable with a friend and decide the subjects from your 1st-4th/5th years and other relevant topics that you want to read for the interviews.\nResources\nI just went through the posts in ambitionbox and other such websites for each company. Tried to look up commonly asked question types. It particularly helped in preparing for the tests, which are usually the first round.\nCivil Engineering\nChandan Verma - Placed at Shapoorji Pallonji Group\nWhat was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.\nCompanies in the civil sector usually follow a 3 rounds process, starting with the Resume short listing, Group Discussion and then the final Personal Interview Round. Civil Sector comprises are of two types, construction companies and the engineering consultants. Construction companies are usually looking up for management skills along with the technical skills as compared to the engineering consultants which are more of focused on the technical knowledge. Therefore the selection process of construction firms will also require a good communication skills along with sound technical knowledge.\nThe selection process of Shapoorji Pallonji Group comprised of 3 rounds. In the first round consisted of a technical(MCQ) test and a verbal ability[MCQ] test. Further the shortlisted students had a Group Discussion round, followed by the last round of Personal Interview where questions related to HR and Technical were asked.\nWhat are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for?\nHR questions like, Tell me about yourself? or Introduce yourself? or Walk me through your resume? are very common and mostly the opening questions.\nIf you have thought of entering into this sector you should always be prepared for the questions like, Why Civil? Why construction? Why not some non-core firms? Will you be able to work on field if required? and if you are from particular specialization like Structural Engg. then be prepared to face, Why not design? Why only construction?\nWhat are things students can do from now till December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector?\nFirst of all it is very important to make up your mind whether you want to go into this sector or not, riding with legs on different boat never helps. So look up good for the pros and cons and then only continue with your preparations. For preparations for technical rounds, I suggest you just need to start brushing up the material of your courses till the 6th semester, prepare a notebook to write up the key formulas and tips that you will need to give a quick look before your interviews. For the preparations for HR rounds, I suggest keep practicing group discussions with your friends, try to write answers to the commonly asked HR questions and prepare up your resume well.\nAutomobile\nManufacturing\nOcean Engineering and Naval Architecture\nGaurav Kumar Jha - Placed at Mazagon Dock Ltd.\nWhat was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.\nShort PPT--> A 45 mins test ---> immediate results (in about 20 mins) arranged performance wise (13 people shortlisted) -->Detailed PPT ---> Interview (called in the same order of results), only\n1 round\nof interview covering both technical and HR rounds\nWhat are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for?\nAbout the test\n- Not a difficult test to crack if your basics are sound. It consisted of 20 short MCQs (easy) covering metacentric height calculations, trim, MCT etc. Mainly covering hydrostatics (most imp), sea keeping & maneuvering, structural terms etc. It had two 5 marks questions - to draw a standard mid ship section, and identify some structural terms like deck girder, beam, bilge keel, floor etc. and the other was to identify ship types for some given ships (Titanic, INS virat etc). Finally 2 hydrostatics numericals, 10 marks each were asked.\nTest Preparation Tips\n- Hydrostatics is the most important thing to be studied. I referred to \"Introduction to Naval Architecture by Eric Tupper\" for quick revision.The numericals asked, were very similar to solved examples. I had my 2nd Year's internship over there. That helped a lot. You should have a little idea of ships built over there, mainly the ship types. Stay attentive during the intro/ ppt, they talk about it. Don't hurry during the test, there's ample amount of time.\nInterview Tips\n-  Be very thorough with your internships and project. Two of my internships were core, the other was a steel plant training. All technical questions asked were related to the core internships. They may re-frame some situations(from internship) or may go into more depths of the topic covered in internships/ projects. You might not get to the final solution directly. They mainly check your approach, they also help you and give appropriate hints if your approach is right. Explain them what you are thinking, properly. In some cases (not for me) they also asked areas of interest, choose a topic you are very confident with.\nFor HR round you need to show them how interested you are really in joining the company and why you are a good fit for them. They also ensure that you don't run away too soon. So make sure you don't give that impression. Be confident, and explain yourself properly, give instances from your CV if possible to support your answers. For eg, I was asked at the end, are you ready to learn new things / do u mind learning completely new stuff.., to which i quoted from my internship where i learnt something new and completed my job and about my BTP where i was learning something new. Extra acads (mine were decent) was a field they did not touch directly but I bought that up in the conversation to support something and they had to notice.\nChemical Engineering\nOil & Gas\nBiotechnology\nOther Links\nThis section includes links to articles written by people who have sat in CDC interviews for placements and internships or have sat offline.\nHimanshu Mundhra\nSee Also\nResources for Placements\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Placement_Interview_Experiences&oldid=97071\n\""

In initial stages, the questions can appear straightforward but the complexity increases when we talk about sequences/series of a function. If you were not attentive during start, you will find it difficult to stay with the course work after mid sems. Also, the applications of the things taught in this course can be useful later on in other courses.\nThe course is easily one of the most interesting course of the Department. The course is very well planned. The course starts from very fundamental questions like What actually a Real Number is? How did human intuition firstly think of Real Number?. The course offers a great platform for thinking and answers many things that we have just accepted in our childhood. The course starts from defining a Real Number,Defining sequences about it,Analyzing their properties,Defining functions about them and Defining sequences about the function. Most of the course may seem very obvious to many but the course offers good platform for Higher Mathematics to be learnt later\nHow to Crack the Paper\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nNC333\nThursday\nNC333\nFriday\nNC333\nNC333\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=MA31005:_Real_Analysis&oldid=103631\n\""
