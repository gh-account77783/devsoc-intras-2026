So, we here come forward to enrich the lives of students and provide them with a broad platform where they can learn a lot of skills, showcase their talents and develop self-confidence and potential to achieve heights of glory. So,\nRajasthan Cultural Association\nconduct various events at regular intervals for proper intermixing of students with one another for their all-round development.\nOrigin\nThe foundation stone of this journey was laid with the idea of brotherhood and unity among diversity. It was an attempt to encourage students to come together to learn extracurricular activities beyond their academics. RCA has grown up as a prestigious organization over the years, with more than 50 alumni placed at various corporate and government organizations. A dedicated team is working towards achieving new milestones every year.\nVision\nOur vision is to spread the rich culture of Rajasthan in the KGP community along with the celebration of festivals which are a major missing for a student far from his home. We are always progressing on the path of reaching more KGPians and involving them in various cultural activities\nEvents\nFreshers' Welcome\nMalhar-The Cultural Night\nPatang-The Kite Festival\nKhamma Ghani-Food Festival\nRammat-Sports Event\nFarewell & Trip\nCapture the Thrill\nOnline Quiz\nEducation Drive\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Rajasthan_Cultural_Association&oldid=239451\n\""

Since it's foundation in the year 2012, where it was recognized as an official part of\nTechnology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur\n, it has grown ahead in multiple dance forms like Locking, Popping, Breaking, House, Dancehall, Litefeet and Whacking. It participates in Street as well as Western Stage dance competitions across India. It also organizes workshops for western dance enthusiasts at IIT Kharagpur. The society exhibits creative contents through\nYouTube\nfrom time to time. However, the official announcements are passed on through the\nInstagram\npage.\nJoining the team\nThe auditions for TDS are conducted post a dance workshop session conducted inside the campus after the arrival of its new batch of freshers around the first week of august. The auditions are open for all students inside IIT Kharagpur. There is no restriction on dance style, age, course or study period of the student.\nSelection Criteria\nThe participants of the auditions are asked to perform a one-minute piece of dance routine on their choice of song and dance style. They are also allowed to perform on the routine taught to them during the workshop. The dance performance can be original or inspired, but not exactly copied. There is no restriction to any dance forms. There may be a second round consisting of an impromptu performance of approximately 30 seconds. The participants are marked on the following :\nBeat sense\nChoreography\nEnergy\nInterest\nThe auditions are known to be easy and every year, around 30 students are selected as new members of the society.\nTimeline of Events\nThe society’s first showcase of the year takes place during the Freshers’ Induction Program in the last week of July, where members present an 8–10 minute group performance before the new students. Following the freshers’ selections, the next major event is the showcase performance on\nInstitute Foundation Day\non\n18th August\n. This 10–15 minute performance marks the debut of the society’s new choreographers of the\nGoverning Batch\n, comprising the third-year members and features all the dancers of the society, including the newly inducted ones.\nThe next major milestone is the\nInter IIT Cultural Meet\n, held in December, followed by participation in\nSpring Fest (IIT Kharagpur)\n. Soon after comes the lively\nHoli Flashmob\n, where the entire Breakfree team reunites to perform in front of the crowd at Gymkhana.\nThe society also represents the institute at several prestigious outstation cultural festivals such as\nAntaragni (IIT Kanpur)\nand\nCarpe Diem (IIM Calcutta)\n. The year concludes with the\nAnnual Junior Championship\n, where the junior members showcase everything they have learned throughout the year in an exciting dance competition.\nPractice Sessions\nThe members of the society meet almost everyday to jam and prepare for competitions. The main team is divided into 2 different sections - Stage and Street. The practices for both sections are designed on the basis of competition requirement. Every year, a team of 30-40 members participates in Stage events and a team of 8-10 members participates in Street battles.\nWorkshops\nApart from routine practices, the members of the society participate in workshops conducted in Kolkata by renowned independent dancers and crews. The society also conducts open workshops inside the campus.\nList of Governors & Choreography Heads\n2024-25\nChoreography Head:\nSiddhata Sudhakar Gadhe\nGovernors:\nDibya Ranjan Samal\nTushar Dabi\nBanoth Yamini\nAtullyatej Ranasingh\n2023-24\nChoreography Head:\nSanjana Singh\nGovernors:\nBharat Kabra\nNikhil Atram\nAnanya Pandey\n2022-23\n2022-23\nTridibesh Naik\nIshank Gupta\nVibhusha Sontakke\nGaurav Semwal\n2021-22\nAjith Sree Madhav\nSameer Gautam\nShreya Kumari\nSoorsri Thashkant\n2020-21\n2020-21\nMonika Choudhary\nPranali Rahangdale\nShivam Sengar\nTausif Mohammad\n2019-20\n2019-20\nAshish Meena\nMayank Lalwani\nMilan Chauhan\nShippee Sunda\n2018-19\n2018-19\nDhaval Chauhan\nMonika Tamsoy\nPranay Kumar Mahapatra\nSandeep Sharma\n2017-18\n2017-18\nAnkit Singh\nNupur Jain\nPukhraj Baraskar\nShubham Annapure\n2016-17\n2016-17\nRajat Gupta\nRakesh Ravikumar\nSakshi Garg\nShraddha Mehta\n2015-16\n2015-16\nNikhil Kothari\nPrachi Gupta\nRimil Hembrom\nSagar Kalbande\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Technology_Dance_Society&oldid=239664\n\""

It is now known as\nMetahub\n. The permanent hub address is\ndc.metakgp.org\n.\nHistory\nThis section requires\nexpansion\n.\nIn March 2016,\nThe Scholars' Avenue\npublished a story covering the gradual decline of the hub.\n[\n1\n]\nAbout\n\"HiT Hi FiT Hai\" hub intends to provide service to users willing to share \"legal\", \"non objectionable\" content. However the hub only provides a \"connectivity layer\" and a message board for the users and has no control over items shared or posted.The hub takes no responsibility for, does not expressly or implicitly endorse, and does not assume any liability for any content submitted by the users. The user, and the user alone is  responsible for their activity on the hub. By entering into the hub you agree to these terms and conditions. The hub scripts are all work of admin and operators and all rights regarding it are reserved to respective authors.\nHub Details\n[\n2\n]\n:\nHub Address     -\ndc.metakgp.org\nAdmin               -  proffapt\nOperators         -\nGODs               -\nVIPs                 -\nTerminology\nHHFH: Abbreviation of HiT Hi FiT Hai.\nMirror: Mirroring means sharing the files that you have downloaded from DC. It is expected from all the users that they mirror all the stuff. This is the easiest way to contribute to HHFH.\nLeecher: Those users who have a negative effect on the DC network by having a very poor share ratio, downloading much more than they upload. Leeches don't leave their DC client open to mirror the file after their download has completed. Some leeches intentionally avoid uploading by using modified clients or excessively limiting their upload speed.\nUptime: Time period for which a user is online.\nDC MC: Stands for DC main chat.\nMagnet: Magnets exists only for files and not for directories. Different files have different magnets, same files have same magnets. Right click on any file and select Copy magnet link.\nMods: They are the moderators of HHFH. Ask on DC MC for more info.\nBasic Rules\nMinimum limit for connecting is: 0 GiB. For searching and downloading: 100 GiB for now.\nSharing porn/linking-to-files-on DC which are marked NSFW is strictly prohibited.\nDon't use offensive language in common chat room. Don't spam in common chat room. Help make it a safe/riskfree hub for everyone.\nFake Sharing is NOT allowed here. Anybody found sharing fake will be banned immediately.\nDon't share crap like Windows and Program Files directory. You can be banned for 1-3 hours.\nNO upload speed limiting is allowed here (can be banned for this).\nAdd your Name Tags only at the end of filename and not before it.\nAll users are expected to mirror their downloads. Those who do not mirror could be subjected to bans depending on their leeched content.\nNick registration\nYou can register your nick with a password. Registrations are generally opened on weekends.\nRegistered users can\n:\nChat on main chat.\nAdd requests for any stuff.\nAccess Buy and Sell.\nHow to register your nick\nSearch your nick in the users tab.\nRight click on nick and select register nick\nA prompt appears wherein you need to set password, be careful as it asks only once for password.\nRestart the DC++ client and you will be greeted with a screen where you need to enter your password.\nMinimum file share\nThe minimum file share is set to 0 GiB for a short while when a new college term starts, to allow students to build up their share. After this initial period, a minimum file share size is imposed with the aim of increasing the availability and replication of files shared (mirroring). Users with a file share size less than this limit cannot search or download files, but can still access other features.\nThe current minimum file share size is\n100 GiB\n.\n[\n3\n]\nFeatures and User Commands\nAccessing user commands\nUser Commands\nOffline message to user : If a user is offline, message to them can be sent via this command. Nick of the user must be known to use this command.\nFile report : Fake/Misnamed/Personal/Program files can be reported via this command to VIPs. Enter the magnet of the file and mention why this file is reported.\nRegistration : This command helps user to register a new nick, change password of existing nick and delete an existing nick. Registrations are generally opened on weekends, watch out for Hub Topic to know when registrations are open.\nChat History : Retrieve upto 100 recent messages of main chat. Alternatively, '+history x' can be typed in main chat, where x=[1,100].\n[BOT]Info Command\nGuestbook : Express views about HHFH. Can be used to view previous entries and add new entries.\nBuy and Sell : View, add or delete any buy or sell requests.\nRequests : There are 3 options, namely view, add and handle. Add requests for any stuff that is not available on DC++. It is advised to search at least 3-4 times at different timings before adding a request. Notify the user who requested about the status of their requested item via Handle command.\nSuggestions : Recommend stuff to fellow users.\nNews : News forum of HHFH.\nThing Delete : Notify fellow users before deleting an unique stuff that you have. Fellow users are recommended to mirror that stuff.\nMiscellaneous\nBrowsing the latest content with single command / single click.\nFour separate chatrooms supporting anonymous chats, user subscription, listing subscribed users, denying messages from unsubscribed users, message logging and Individual chat history.\nYou can access the latest database of HHFH in your DC client or in the browser at\nHHFH webpage\n(the proxy needs to be bypassed). \"Bhaat forums\" are also hosted at the same IP.\nTips and Tricks\nSearch for alternatives: Right-click on any file and select 'search for alternatives' option to find other sources of same file.\nBrowse/Get file list: Right-click on any file and select 'Browse file list' to see location of file. Use this to see the folder in which the file exists, this will help you find other files related to it.\nSpy Search: Use this to see what fellow users are searching.\nPrivate message (PM): Right click on a username and select 'Send private message' to chat with that user. Only you and that user can see this chat.\nMirroring is the easiest way to not get banned.\nGive autoslots to favourite users. Right click on a username and select add to favourites, then open favourite users tab to give autoslots.\nTroubleshooting\nAll issues faced by users on the hub can be addressed either by contacting Admin/Operators/VIPs or by the official\nfacebook page\n.\nContributing\nHHFH runs on PtokaX DC Hub. PtokaX DC Hub is a multi-platform server application for Neo-Modus Direct Connect (NMDC) Peer-To-Peer sharing network. You can contribute to HHFH on\ngithub\n. You can also contribute to HHFH by adding content to the latest database.\nSee also\nDC\nInstitute proxies\nExternal links\nMirror Mirror on the Fall : The Story of Hit Hi FiT Hai\nReferences\n↑\n\"Mirror Mirror on the Fall : The Story of Hit Hi FiT Hai\"\n.

For example, third year B.Tech (Hons.) students will have the option to switch over from 4 year B.Tech (Hons.) course to a 5 year Dual Degree course in the same department, including a choice of the specialization.\n[\n1\n]\nSwitch over to Interdisciplinary Dual Degree\nStudents admitted to the 4-year B. Tech (Hons.) / 5-year Dual Degree Program through\nJEE (Advanced)\nare eligible for switch over to the Dual Degree programs of\nEngineering Entrepreneurship\n/\nFinancial Engineering\n. The constraints for such arrangement is that the interested student must have completed all the prescribed course work for the first two semesters in first attempt with a minimum\nCGPA\nof 6.00.\nThe notification is brought during the spring semester of academic year, and accordingly, an eligible student must make his application through i) online application and ii) submission of signed hard copy to\nacademic section\nby the specified deadline.\nAn important point to that note that application for branch change is also made during the same time, and both of these processes are independent of each other. In case an application is approved for the both, change of branch allotted to a student would prevail over the option of Interdisciplinary Dual Degree Program.\nSwitch over to Dual Degree\nThird year B.Tech (Hons.) students have an option to switch over to an existing 5-year Dual Degree course (\none-way and not the reverse\n) in the same department, including a choice of specialization, offered at 2-year M.Tech. level in the Department maintaining proportionate distribution of seats.\nThe student must have completed all the curricular requirements up to sixth semester and must not have any backlog subjects with a minimum CGPA of 6.00.

The program is hosted by Kharagpur Open Source Society, an independent student group at\nIIT Kharagpur\n, but is open to students of any university.\nThe motive of organizing the program is to help students have one-on-one mentorship in the early phase of contributing to open source software. This also helps the students, especially freshmen and sophomores in their preparation for\nGoogle Summer of Code\nwhich takes place annually in March.\nKharagpur Winter of Code has been online since its inception and operates on its website\nhttps://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org\nOverview\nThe program invites mentors who have ownership or collaborative rights on open source software projects, to register the projects. In the last week of November, the list of accepted projects is released on the website and students begin signing up for the program. Students then start to look through the projects and choose one or more of their choice.\nCoding period for KWoC begins in the first week of December. Students now contact the mentors, look through issues to fix or new ideas to implement. The communication and activity of students and mentors is monitored by the program managers and any necessary help is provided by KOSS. Students have to submit their project reports by January 6th, while the successful participation of students depends on the work they do and their mentor's evaluation.\nDetailed role descriptions and goals are discussed in the\nStudent's Manual\nand the\nMentor's Manual\nof the program.\nHistory\n2016\nTop 3 contributors of KWoC 2016 along with KOSS team\nIn 2016, the program was announced on November 20th.\n[\n1\n]\nAround 930 students registered for the program along with 70 mentors.

The Hall firmly believes in its motto:\nSanskrita Striya Parashakti.\nHistory\nSN/IG hall of residence is one of the oldest hall in the Institute.\nFor decades, the Hall has been the home away from home for both undergraduate and postgraduate women students. Despite the fewer number of its residents, the SN/IG Hall has carved its own niche in both academics and in various socio-cultural and sports events and competitions organized by the students’ Gymkhana. The Hall is also actively involved in all major students’ events such as the Spring Fest, Kshitij etc. In addition to representing IIT Kharagpur in various teams in Inter-IIT competitions, its residents have also consistently held offices at Technology Students’ Gymkhana.\nInfrastructure\nThe hall is divided into A, B, C, E, F, G, H, N, NR, W, S blocks. in four different buildings.\nOther facilities\nSports facilities\nThe has its own basket ball court, well equipped gym, table tennis facilites.\nMusic room\nThe hall has a well furnished music room for singing and dance practices.\nHall Library\nThe hall has its own library managed by the student body that issues books to the hall borders for a complete semester.\nFood and eateries\nThere is night canteen, Store, fruit stall and Nescafe in the hall.\nCommon rooms\nThere are two common rooms in the hall- Old and the new one. The new common room is well furnished air conditioned and has TV connection, projector screen.\nStudy room\nThere is one study room with the AC and capacity of 24 students attached with library.\nSpacious lawns\nGym Room\nWe have a fully functioning air conditioned GYM open 24/7\nAlumni\nThe bond that grows by living together in the same Hall has knitted many generations of SN/IG residents together. Its alumni are spread over the globe holding prestigious positions in academics, in corporate organizations, and other fields. To name just a few, Dr Parvati Dev (B.S.1968) Director, Stanford University School of Medicine, and President, IIT Foundation, late Dr Nina Saxena (B Tech 1992), Dr Chaitali Sengupta (B.Tech 1992), systems architect in Texas Instruments and one among the 100 Top Young Innovators of 2004 (MIT Technology Review), Dr. Sanghamitra Bandopadhyay, Indian Statistical Institute, Dr Serene Bannerjee (B.Tech 1999) of INTEL, Lachmi Khemlani (B Arch,.1990), author, instructor at UC Berkeley, researcher, and consultant in CAD. etc.\nThe Hall allows its residents a taste of both freedom and responsibility as the affairs of the hall are managed by the students themselves. SN/IG Hall shall continue to churn out well-educated, empowered and aware citizens, dedicated to strive for excellence in their fields, thus reflecting the changing face of the new generation of Indian women.\nHall Council 2023-2024\nHall President\n-\nSakshi Agarwal\nSecond Senate Member\n-\nRhea Vigil\nGsec Technology\n-  Akula Tejaswini\nGsec Social Cultural\n- Deepanajana Chakravarty\nGsec Maintenance\n-\nAnindita Malviya\n& Astha Kumari\nGsec Alumni Affairs\n-\nAnanya Singh\nGsec Mess -\nPornima Gaikwad\nGsec Library\n- Lakhavath Niharika\nGsec Students Welfare\n- Gayathri Amulya\nGsec Sports & Games\n- Pravalika Das\nEvents\nIllumination -\nThe biggest Gymkhana event... It is the event that everyone participates in (willingly or otherwise) for a whole month. All for a matka of sweets! The ILU part really takes a lot more time (cleaning diyas, wiring them, drawing chatais, etc...) a shortage of man-power on the actual event date greatly restricts plans. However, SN has been doing very well in Rangoli off-late. A picture of the '96 rangoli (3rd position) is given above.\nHall-day  -\nThe one time of the year when you can bring guests to your room (without having to be critically ill!). The hall is decorated with lights and all, everybody buys a lot of food, and the E-TMS very obligingly puts up a performance. Authorities are usually worried about 'uninvited-guests'... so residents have to set up an extensive 'security' system to check for invitations.\nFresher's welcome-\nJust as the name suggests, it marks the end of the OP. Restrictions have now made it very hard to have an OP of any sort but the fresher's welcome still is the greatest source of entertainment.\nSophomore Party -\nJust as the name suggests, it marks the welcome of sophomores in the hall. Nowadays freshers are allocated IGH and onboarding of second years happens in snig not freshers anymore so we have this party and its there first party in the hall and it is the greatest source of entertainment and it marks the beginning of hall bonding\nFinal year Farewell -\nThe final year farewell is markedly sober... ending in massive senti sessions with the final years handing out perps awards. It involves an extensively planned programme, a catwalk, a 'Miss SN' competition and some 'best senior in such and such awards'. This is accompanied by special dinner (where the mess ammas actually put up a good show) and ends in a lot of tempo shouts and dancing.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Sarojini_Naidu_/_Indira_Gandhi_Hall_of_Residence&oldid=238369\n\""

        "title": "Heimdall",
        "content": "In Norse mythology,\nHeimdall\n(from Old Norse\nHeimdallr\n) is a god. He is the son of Odin and nine mothers. Heimdall keeps watch for invaders and the onset of Ragnarök from his dwelling Himinbjörg, where the burning rainbow bridge Bifröst meets the sky. [REF.\nHeimdall Wikipedia\n]. So basically he is the gatekeeper to Asgard.\nThere are times where someone needs to develop an application accessible only when connected to campus network yet they can't host it on campus network for various valid reasons. Here's where Heimdall comes to save the day! Keeping watch for\ninvaders\n(request from outside campus network) invading\nAsgard\n(the application without **\na backend**\n). So let's discuss what black magic you need to apply to achieve this.\nYou just need to send a\nGET request\nto\nhttps://heimdall.metakgp.org\n. It returns a json response with single entry (refer below). If \"\nis_inside_kgp\n\" is\ntrue\nthen the request came from within campus network otherwise it originated from outside campus network, pretty straight forward, right?\n{\n\"is_inside_kgp\"\n:\nfalse\n}\nYou must be wondering what black magic are we doing to be able to achieve this. You can refer to the code at\nhttps://github.com/metakgp/heimdall\n, here the need is more clearly defined in respect to frontend applications.\nNeed for Heimdall\nQuoting the particular section for the\ngithub repository\n:\nAll this time you might be wondering why you need a different server to just check this. Can't we do this in any project where such a feature is required?\n\nWell yes. Provided it has a backend server. This cannot be done in the front-end because the Web Browser does not provide the IP information to the Javascript engine. So for projects that do not need a backend, like [\nChillzone\n](\nhttps://github.com/metakgp/chillzone\n) or [\nERP Auto Login\n](\nhttps://github.com/metakgp/iitkgp-erp-auto-login\n), this simple API call can do the required work.\nOther solutions\nIf your application has a backend then you can choose to use this or you can do it in other ways. One of them is:\nSend ping request to any internally hosted `\n*.iitkgp.ac.in\n` site.\nIf the ping is successful, the request originated from within the campus network otherwise it came from outside. There is a demo implementation in\niitkgp-erp-login-pypi\n.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Heimdall&oldid=238289\n\""

        "title": "How to get a visa to USA",
        "content": "A large number of students go to United States for research internships, further studies or conferences. Obtaining a VISA is the second most important step after securing an offer confirmation from your host institution or organization. Of all the countries, United States has the most time consuming visa process.\nBelow we describe the process of obtaining different types of visa.\nPlease note that the information below (especially the payment amounts) may become outdated. Please cross-verify with the linked sources.\nB1/B2 visa\nCredit:  Vivek Rai (BT '17)\nB1/B2 visa is the tourism and business visa for temporary visit. This is the visa you need if you are visiting USA for a conference or competition. The\nconsulate office website\nhas given comprehensive information on the B-visa process which includes filling up an online form, paying the visa fees, scheduling an appointment, giving your biometric information and finally appearing for an interview at consulate office. The whole process typically takes 2 to 4 weeks.\nDocuments\nDuring the interview at the consulate office you need to prove the legitimacy of your visit, and it is recommended that you carry the following documents before the interview:\nInvitation Letter\nBonafide certificate\nLatest resume\nOfficial transcript\nBank Statement\nFlight tickets (if booked)\nCosts\nThe visa fee is 160 USD which can be paid through\nNEFT, IMPS\nor\ncash-deposit at select banks.\nThe bank details are available after scheduling the appointment.\nJ1 visa\nCredit: Vivek Rai (BT '17)\nJ1 is an\nExchange Visitor\nvisa. It is a\nnon-immigrant, temporary\nvisa issued to trainees or interns for a fixed period of time. If you are currently studying and are accepted by an institution or company in United States for summer, J1 is the most appropriate visa type for you. J1 visa requires a government authorized sponsor agency. A sponsor agency is simply a third-party organization which will handle all the documents and necessary paperwork for your visa at some cost. Typically, your host institution itself (if a major university) will be a sponsor, otherwise would advise you to contact a different sponsor. The overall visa process, depending on your type, might take anywhere between 1 to 3 months.\nThe first step is to get in touch with a sponsor organization. The HR manager of your host institution will have specific advise on this matter. Once you have a sponsor ready to handle your application, the following steps follow:\nObtain the invitation letter from your institution.\nComplete Trainee/Intern Agreement (TIA) and Trainee/Intern Placement Plan (TIPP) agreements. Your sponsor may request additional documents like\nbonafide certicate\nand resume.\nYour sponsor organization's coordinator or your inviting faculty will schedule an interview to fill your SEVIS record.\nSign the agreements as necessary.\nThe sponsor will process your\nDS2019 form\nand send to you by post. The mail will also contain additional documents like a signed TIPP plan (also called\nDS 7002 form\n), a\nsocial security application letter\nand other documents (insurance, for example).\nComplete online\nDS160 form\n, pay\nSEVIS fee\nusing the details provided by your sponsor. Retain printout of everything.\nSchedule a visa appointment. An additional appointment for biometric collection is also scheduled.\nVisit the consulate/embassy (in Kolkata or as mentioned in your online forms) with the documents.\nDocuments\nDS 2019\nDS 7002\nInvitation/Offer letter\nDS 160 confirmation printout\nSEVIS fee payment receipt\nSocial Security Application letter\nA copy of bank statement (with sufficient balance) -\nsuggested\nBonafide certificate\n-\nsuggested\nResume -\nsuggested\nCosts\nYour sponsor will typically require a processing fee payment before sending your DS 2019. It can vary anywhere between 500 USD to 2500 USD. It is typically paid through\ncredit card\nor\ninternational wire-transfer.\nSEVIS fee is 180 USD. It can be paid only though\na\ncredit card.\nScheduling an appointment requires another 160 USD. It can be paid through\nNEFT, IMPS\nor\ncash-deposit at select banks.\nThe bank details are available after scheduling the appointment.\nTime\nAfter receiving your DS 2019,\nit can take anywhere between 2-3 weeks. Typically, the nearest appointment is available after 4-6 days and once your visa is issued, it will take another week before you can collect it. The time before DS 2019 can vary depending on how fast you complete the formalities. However, there can often be delays because of additional administrative processing called by the consul officer before a visa is issued. If additional processing is required, add another 4 weeks of time.\nTotal: 1-2 months for visa.\nPlease plan well before.\nF1 visa\nCredit: Debanjana Chakraborty (CY '17)\nF1 is a non-immigrant, temporary visa required by those aiming for studying and getting a degree (Bachelors/Masters/Doctorate) from a US university. One can apply for an F1 visa after getting an official acceptance/invitation letter and the I-20 form from a US university approved by SEVP (Student and Exchange Visitor Program). The I-20 form you receive will contain all the required information for starting your visa application i.e. SEVIS ID; school name, code, address and official contact; course and duration of study; estimated costs and funding source(s).\nThe F1 visa application process is quite similar to that of J1 visa and is relatively easier to get. The only difference is that in case of F1, you will receive I-20 form from the concerned university instead of DS2019 form. Students accepted for a doctorate program may get a DS2019 form or I-20 form from the university, depending on the nature of program and slots available for J1 visas in the university. In that case, it is best for the student to get in touch with the OIS (Office of International Services) of the university and figure out what type of visa will be much more suitable and relevant. The first step is to obtain the official admissions offer letter and I-20 form from the university or research institute/centre. If the university is fully or partially funding your tuition fees and living expenses, that will be mentioned in your offer letter and I-20 form. In case, funding is arranged from personal resources or third party organization, the same should be notified to the university after you accept the offer with required documents as per university guidelines\nAfter you obtain the form, you need to pay the\nSEVIS\nfees (generally known as I-901 fee). The present fee is 200$ and payable online only through credit card. After payment, obtain and take a printout of SEVIS I-901 payment confirmation slip. Please note that it might take 2-3 working days for your payment to be processed and acknowledged\nYou need to fill up the\nDS-160\nform before paying the visa appointment fees and making an appointment. Please ensure that the information you fill is correct. Obtain and take a printout of the DS-160 confirmation slip, which will be required during your visa interview.\nYou can now proceed with visa appointment fee payment and date scheduling\nhere\n. You need to pay 160$ for appointment confirmation and schedule two date- one for biometrics followed by interview at the nearest consulate. Obtain and take a print out of the appointment confirmation, which you require for both biometrics and consulate interview. The amount can be paid through NEFT, IMPS or cash-deposit at select banks. The bank details are available after scheduling the appointment\nDocuments\nI-20 form\nAdmissions offer letter (both from the graduate school and specific program, if any)\nSEVIS I-901 payment confirmation slip\nDS-160 confirmation printout\nAppointment confirmation slip\nProof of immediate availability of sufficient funds to cover tuition fees and living expenses for the first two semesters (bank balance statement, sanctioned loan documents, funding approval letter from third party organization or sponsors etc.). For those who are receiving full funding from the university, the I-20 form and offer letter will suffice.\nProof of English proficiency (highly suggested in case your I-20 form does not mention about the same; TOEFL, IELTS score or bonafide certificate from your current institute if it follows a English-medium curriculum)\nRecent academic transcripts and backlog clearance proof, if any (suggested)\nYour resume (suggested)\nAny handbook, prescribed by your university, with detailed description of your coursework and your program specifics (suggested)\nPrevious US visa details and name and references of contacts established in US, in case you have been to US before through other visa type (highly suggested)\nNotes\nPreparing for F1 visa interview After you receive your I-20 form, it might take at least 4-5 weeks or as long as 2-3 months before you obtain your visa. It is recommended that you start the application process as soon as you receive the official documents. However, you need to keep certain things in mind.\nIf your study program and degree is unfunded or partially funded, you need to arrange for suitable financial resources and veritable proof for the same before your visa interview. Do not rely on future arrangements and never try to assure the same to the interviewing officer. Have your funding sources and documents ready.\nYou need to check whether your program of study or course falls under TAL (Technology Alert List) or related to any of the listed subjects. You can do so by contacting the OIS or any senior of yours enrolled in similar course in US. If yes, then you should apply for visa as soon as possible since your application can be subjected to additional processing (221g) and your visa may be delayed for another 4-5 weeks. See administrative processing section.\nYou need to prepare for the interview. Any reluctance or lack of confidence while answering the interviewer’s questions can lead to rejection of your visa. You can find a list of few questions asked to previous applicants here. You can prepare your answers beforehand and choose your words carefully to avoid any kind of conflict in your answers.\nSince F1 is a non-immigrant visa, you need to assure the interviewer that you are not planning to stay in US beyond your estimated period of study or training. Avoid saying things like you wish to settle in US or you are looking for a permanent job there.\nYou need to be well acquainted with information related to F1 visa, your university and your study program, your future career plans, how well aware you are about the living conditions and location of your university.\nAdditional Processing\nIn case the consul officer sends your visa application for additional administrative processing, your\npassport will be returned along with a 221(g) letter\nasking for additional documents. Typically, the consulate requires you to submit your resume along with a word document containing answers to a few questions (as specified in document) to a consulate's email address (\n[email protected]\n). Based on your responses, they will process your application and approve the visa. Once approved, you will asked to drop off your passport the Kolkata VAC for final visa processing.\nThis is a time consuming step and can take anywhere between\n3-6 weeks.\nIt is difficult to predict whether your application will go for additional processing but a good indication is whether your field is included in\nTechnology Alert List\nor not. Even a loose association with the mentioned field might require the processing.\nNavigation\nVisa Application Center\nThe best way to reach the VAC office is to take a local train to\nSantragachi\nrailway station\n.\nIt takes approximately 2 hours from Kharagpur. From there, take any bus to Exide/Minto Park (almost all buses go to Exide) and get down at Shakespeare Sarani, Birla Planetarium, or Minto Park --- takes approximately half an hour. You can walk to your destination from there.\nU.S. Consulate\nIt is recommended to reach Howrah Railway Station and take a cab from there to directly reach the consulate. Also, if the appointment is in early morning and one does not wish to leave early, a guest room can be booked at IIT Kharagpur's Kolkata Guest House for an overnight stay.\nSee also\nHow to get a visa to Canada\nHow to get an official transcript\nHow to get a Bonafide Certificate\nExternal links\nB-visa\nStep-by-step non immigrant visa information\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_get_a_visa_to_USA&oldid=17790\n\""

        "content": "[DEPRECATED]\nFROM 2024 BATCH, THE OPTION FOR DEPARTMENT CHANGE HAS BEEN\nABOLISHED\n, NOW BEING REPLACED BY\nDOUBLE MAJOR\n.\nChange of the branch is a privilege and not a right. Only those students admitted to B.Tech.(Hons.) / Dual Degree / Integrated M.Sc. Programs through JEE (Advanced) are eligible to be considered for a change of branch after the Second (Spring) Semester as per the following rules\n[\n1\n]\n:\nTo be eligible for consideration for a change of branch the following conditions must be satisfied:\nHe/she must have completed all the credits prescribed in the first two semesters of the course, in his/her first attempt, without having had to pass any course requirement in the re-examination, supplementary examination and/or summer quarter.\nHe/she must have obtained a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) not lower than 8.5 at the end of the Second (Spring) Semester.\nHe/she must not have been punished for any offence by the Standing Institute Disciplinary Committee or the Committee on Prevention of Examination Malpractices at anytime prior to the notification for the change of branch.\nApplication for a change of branch must be made by intending eligible students when the notification is made during the Spring Semester of the academic year.The students have to accordingly (i) apply online and (ii) submit signed hardcopy to Academic Section by the specified deadline.\nStudents admitted to 4-Year B.Tech.(Hons.) and 5-Year Integrated M.Sc. programs are eligible for consideration for a change of branch to any Engineering or a Science discipline.\nStudents admitted to a 5-Year Dual Degree Program are eligible for a change to another 5-Year Dual Degree Program only.\nStudents may enlist up to TEN (10) choices of branch, in order of preference, to which they wish to change over. It will not be permissible to alter the choices after the application has been submitted.\nChange of branch shall be made strictly on the basis of inter se merit of the applicants. For this purpose the CGPA obtained at the end of the Second (Spring) Semester shall be considered. Ties will be broken by the JEE Advanced rank of the applicants.\nBranch Change\nIn making the change of branch, those applicants shall be first considered who have secured a rank within top 1% (one percent), rounded to the nearest integer, amongst all the first year students in terms of the CGPA scored at the end of the Second (Spring) Semester. Change of branch requested for by such applicants shall be made without any constraint on the number of seats.\nThe remaining applicants may be allowed a change of branch, strictly in order of inter se merit, subject to the limitation that the actual number of students in the Third (Autumn) Semester, in the branch to which the transfer is to be made, does not exceed 110% of the sanctioned yearly intake for that branch.\nThe sanctioned yearly intake of a particular branch shall be the number sanctioned by the Senate as the intake for that branch for the particular year of entry of the applicants. To compute the total number of students in the first year, sum of the sanctioned yearly intake of all the branches will be taken. For the purpose of calculating the actual number of students in a particular branch, the number of students joining the branch is to be considered.\nThe academic section will notify the students and display on the notice boards about the changes of the branch at least 7 (seven) days before the assigned date(s) of the registration of the third (Autumn) semester. However, all changes of branch made in accordance with the above rules will be effective from the Third (Autumn) Semester of the applicants concerned. No changes of branch shall be permitted thereafter.\nAll changes of branch will be final and binding on the applicants. No student will be permitted, under any circumstances, to refuse the change of branch offered.\nNotwithstanding the provisions of foregoing paragraphs, the Senate may under very special circumstances, permit the transfer of a student from one branch to another in deviation of the above mentioned rules. In each such case the special reasons for which the transfer is permitted must be recorded in the Senate resolution. Such transfers, if any, will be over and above the regular transfers, and their number will not be counted in the computation of ‘Actual Number of Students’ in a given branch.\nSee also\nDepartment change\nReferences\n↑\nhttps://erp.iitkgp.ernet.in/regulation_UG_corrected.pdf\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_get_a_department_change&oldid=238365\n\""
