It is a dynamic and intellectually stimulating community for students passionate about the study and application of game theory. It had organised various game theory-related events like\nNashify\n,\nWar of Wits\n, Brethren of the Coast and Finance Talk in previous years, designed to promote a culture of game theory on the campus. The Society’s flagship event is Stratathon, a mind-intriguing strategy case competition featured in\nKshitij\n, the Techno-Management fest of IIT Kharagpur, every year.\nHistory\nFounding\nThe\nKGPian Game Theory Society\nwas founded on 19th August 2010 by\nManoj Gadia (07-12)\n. It is a student body which organizes various\nGame Theory\nrelated programs. With a motive of spreading awareness, knowledge and application of Game Theory, first official session of society was 15th June 2011 to 14th June 2012. Since then the society has seen tremendous growth over the years and witnessed good response from students and game theory enthusiasts. By the able guidance and vision of it's founder Manoj Gadia, this society has grown to become a family with more than 50 members.\nMotive\nThe Society was founded with a main motive to promote concepts of Game Theory and Strategic Thinking. Many situations in people's lives make them choose between different options and we always intend to optimize our chances and get the best outcome. This is where Game Theory comes into play. The outcomes decided by the situations provoke us to analyze them statistically and hence choose the optimal solution through various methods and statistics. This society promotes these concepts by various means.\nActivities\nThe Art of Strategy Project\nThis project is started under the advice of Prof. Avinash Dixit, emeritus professor of Princeton University. Society members undergo this self-learning program throughout the year to develop their strategic thinking skills. The Society also makes original questions based on strategic decision-making to compile it as a question bank.\nDiscussion Sessions\nIn discussion sessions, senior members conduct discussion sessions for all the members, explaining the various theoretical concepts, along with interesting games and real-life examples.\nCase Studies\nSociety members practice solving case studies using game theory in our academic meetings. Senior members solve real life case studies in the fields of business and economics.\nGames\nIn society meetings, members play strategy-based games among themselves to learn how to use game theory concepts in a given situation. The games are usually in accordance with the concepts being covered during discussion sessions.\nEvents\nWar of Wits (WOW)\nMain article:\nWar of Wits\nIt is an annual on-spot strategy based competition for students of IIT Kharagpur. The first edition WOW 1.0 was held on Saturday, 30th March 2013 in association with Consulting Club, Vinod Gupta School of Management. More than 300 students participated in the event. The 2nd edition WOW 2.0 was organized on 3rd April 2015 and witnessed a participation of more than 350 students. WOW has been increasingly attracting a good amount of participation from the in-campus students of IIT Kharagpur.\nNashify\nMain article:\nNashify\nIt is the first of its kind game theory based on-spot inter-college event designed and conducted by the The KGPian Game Theory Society in\nKshitij\n2014, the annual techno-management fest of IIT Kharagpur. Drawing from the success of the in-house event War of Wits, Nashify challenged the participants to outwit and outplay their opponents. The event took place on 1st and 2nd February 2014 and saw a participation from 146 teams (438 participants).\nStratathon\nIt is the flagship event of KGTS, which is conducted every year, during Kshitij, IIT Kharagpur. It includes various in-house developed strategic decision-making games, played in various rounds and formats, among the students of colleges from all over India.\nBrethren of the Coast\nThis was one of its kind online event based on Strategic Thinking. It was based on the Classical Game of Pirates dealing with the distribution of 100 coins with interactive Graphical User Interface. It was a 1 week-long event which started on 25th October 2013 and witnessed a participation of more than 1500 students. The game was designed and developed by Sreejith PP and Rishi Mehta in collaboration with Team KGTS.\nStrategia Hub\nSessions have been conducted for the students in the past where they were introduced to the basics of game theory and were involved in taking decisions in certain situations that were simulations of real-life scenarios.\nFinance Talk\nOn 31st March 2012, society conducted a finance talk where final year students who happened to have cleared one or more levels of the prestigious exams of CFA, FRM and CAT were called as guests to share their experiences. The seminar saw a huge participation of around 400 students\nPublications\nThe Strategist\nIt is a periodic newsletter which contains articles that are specially designed to target the in-campus students of IIT Kharagpur having articles and facts ranging to various fields such as leadership, finance, consultancy, and business management. Debut edition was published in April 2012 and had the highest online viewership for any newsletter in IIT Kharagpur till date. Since then society has released 7 editions of The Strategist, which have had the highest viewership in the respective semesters. Society coordinate with Economics Club IIT Delhi and share articles and ideas based on game theory.\nThe Strategist\ncould be read online at:\nhttp://issuu.com/the.kgts\n.\nComic Strips\nSociety design comic strips to provide an interesting overview of Game Theory with a fun touch. With a maximum online reach of over 16000, these comic strips attract wide sections of viewers. These comic strips can be found in the Facebook\npage\n.\nExternal links\nhttps://www.facebook.com/The.KGTS\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kgts.iitkgp/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/the-kgts\nhttps://thekgts.wordpress.com/\nhttp://issuu.com/the.kgts\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=The_KGPian_Game_Theory_Society&oldid=238291\n\""

The tournament is a (group + knockout ) type \ncompetition, conducted in the month of December. The number of participating teams is usually 16, \nwhich are divided into 4 groups. Two teams from each group progress to the quarter finals, from \nwhere the knockout phase starts.\nEach team has 11 players on the field. The duration of the matches played at the Inter IIT Level is \n70 minutes (35 min each half).\nA new rule was introduced in 2015 which allows an extra time of 20 mins (10 mins each half) from \nthe knockout stage, in case the teams are all tied at the end of normal time.\nInfrastructure\nIIT KGP has maintained two full length football fields, which provide enough ground for anyone \nwho wishes to learn this sport. The fields are floodlit; the infrastructure for which has been \nbestowed upon the institute by TATA. It is for this reason that the sports complex is known as the \nTATA SPORTS COMPLEX. The maintenance of these fields is supervised by the veteran football coach, Mr. Ardhendu Kumar \nGhosh. He is an integral part of all the official football activities in the institute.\nTata Sports Complex\nTrials for the Inter IIT Team\nThe selection procedure for the final team for the Inter IIT Sports meet is a semester-long process. \nNo specific trials are conducted. Players who are passionate and determined enough to devote 3-4 \nhours daily at the field make it to the final team. The team list of 16 players is generally released \nabout 3 weeks before the tournament starts. \nWith a view of scouting new talent from the young freshers, a freshers tournament is also \nconducted in the month of August/September.\nPast Performance\n48TH Inter IIT 2012(IIT Roorkee) : Lost 2-1 to Hyderabad in quarter finals (captain : Ravish Roy GG ’14)\n49th Inter IIT 2013 (IIT Guwahati) : Bronze medal (captain : Shailesh Mohan  NA ’14)\n50th Inter IIT 2014 (IIT Bombay) : Bronze medal (captain : Navneet Kumar  GG ’15)\n51st Inter IIT 2015 (IIT Madras) : The sports meet was cancelled at the last moment due to heavy rains in Madras.

It was mentored by Chaitanya Bayanwala, then fourth year, Department of Physics.\nGait Based Identification of People - A project was proposed by Kumar Krishna Agarwal using Microsoft Kinect to use human gait to uniquely identify people. A lot of efforts and time was spent to prove the concept using Microsoft Kinect but multiple hurdles ultimately caused it to be shut down.\nConsequences\nDream-a-bot had its stint for two years and was shut down after that due to lack of interest of the organising body.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Dream-a-Bot&oldid=9376\n\""

It participates with consistent success in\nParliamentary Debates\nacross the world, and had organized the IIT Kharagpur Model United Nations Conference and the IIT Kharagpur Parliamentary Debate in previous years. In 2020, a team from KGP DebSoc went on to become\nthe first all-Indian team to reach the ESL (English-as-Second-Language) finals of Australs\n, one of the most prestigious debating tournaments in the world.\nIn 2024, a team from KGP DebSoc emerged as the\nwinners of ESL (English-as-a-Second-Language) finals of Uhuru Worlds\n, one of the biggest and most prestigious international tournaments.\nCampus events and tournaments\nSelection process\nThe Debating Society is always looking for smart, enthusiastic debaters, and takes in new members all year round. There is no restriction on the year of study, and members have joined as late as 4th year. However, to provide more structured training, and to spread awareness, it holds Fresher Selections and Senior Selections at the beginning of the year. This is followed by a training workshop, which lasts about a month, where newcomers to parliamentary debating are taught various facets and nuances of structured argumentation.\nRegular activities\nThe Debating Society tries to meet at least two times a week for practice sessions. These are usually conducted in the foyer of the Main Building, with multiple debates often happening around the place. University-level competitive debates have two preeminent formats - the 3v3 Asians Parliamentary Debate, and the\nBritish Parliamentary Debate\n, which has four teams of two in a single debate.\nIn addition to foyer debates, it participates in national and international debating competitions all year round. Members choose their own teams or decide to adjudicate. Participating at many high-quality tournaments is regarded as the way to excel, and members are supported by the society for things like getting permissions from professors, and reimbursement of expenses.\nOther events conducted include the Intra-KGP Debate Tournament and the\nFoundation Day\ndebates.\nHistory\nDebating Society member Sanat Mehrotra conducting the freshers' workshop on 18 August 2013.\nKGP Debate Club\nAlthough students have been arguing at IIT Kharagpur for over half a century, the activity was only institutionalized in 2009 as a part of the 'KGP Debate Club'. It was founded by Sumeet Mohanty (BT '11) and started as a loose affiliate of the\nTechnology Literary Society\n(TLS). The KGP Debate Club began its activities on campus as an active interest group and marked IIT Kharagpur's entry into competitive parliamentary debating. Membership was not exclusive - meetings and debates were open to all and were held in the institute foyer. There were only a handful of members in the Autumn of 2009 and almost all the early recruits were from TLS. The NLSPD 2009 in Bangalore was the first tournament at which the KGP Debate Club represented IIT Kharagpur. This was followed by participation at NUJSPD 2010 by a team of freshers. The Debate Club held its first open selections prior to this tournament, and all the participants for the tournament were selected here.\n[\n2\n]\nIncorporation as a Gymkhana society\nIn Autumn, 2010, the KGP Debate Club was formalized as a full-fledged Gymkhana society independent of the TLS. The first governors were Achyut Bihani (BT '12), Shikha Singh (MA '13) and Anand Kr (CS '12).\nEarly in the Autumn of 2011, the number of governors was increased to four, and the KGP Debate Club was rechristened as 'Debating Society, IIT Kharagpur'. Two of the Governors - Adarsh Mathew and Prashanth Durai - commissioned a logo for the society, and it was created by Avik Dey.

        "content": "[DEPRECATED] INSTITUTE NO LONGER USES PROXY.\nInternet connection inside IIT Kharagpur is provided through an HTTP\nProxy server\n. A proxy server acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from internet. For addresses that are on the KGP LAN Network, using the proxy server is not required.\nThe HTTP Proxy is\n172.16.2.30:8080\n(as of 6th July, 2017).\nThe proxy server can be bypassed for the address\n10.0.0.0/8\n. This\nCIDR\naddress will bypass the proxy for all addresses on the KGP network.\nSetup\nWindows\nIn Windows, most GUI programs will internally use Internet Explorer's proxy settings.\nThe default proxy settings can be updated by navigating to Internet Explorer's options.\nTools\n>\nInternet Options\n>\nConnections\n>\nLAN settings.\nThere are some programs however which don't use Internet Explorer's proxy settings. A prominent example of that remains the Windows Store in Windows 8 & 10. They can be set using\nnetsh\n, or network shell, a command-line utility which allows local or remote configuration of network devices such as the interface.\nThe following are some relevant commands (Run\ncmd as an adminisrator\nand type the following) :\n1.\nnetsh winhttp show proxy\n: This command shows the current proxy setting\n2.\nnetsh winhttp reset proxy\n: This command resets the current proxy setting to a direct connection.\n3.\nnetsh winhttp import proxy source=ie\n: This command sets Internet Explorer as the proxy source for\nnetsh\n, thus both sharing the same proxy.\nNote:\nFor some Windows users, the Git Bash accepts the proxy settings as mentioned below for Linux. In the Git Bash command line, input the following proxies:\nhttp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nhttps_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nftp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nLinux\nIn *nix based systems, proxy settings are controlled via environment variables which can be updated in a number of ways. A few of these methods are described below:\nSetting up proxy settings in Ubuntu's Network Manager.\nAutomatic Script\nIf you are on Debian/Ubuntu, use the script provided at the link to set system-wide proxies for mostly used commands instantly.\nhttps://github.com/thealphadollar/set_proxy_kgp\nIf you are on some other Linux distribution, please create an issue at the same repository.\nGUI\nIn most cases, a desktop environment (Unity for example; ships default with Ubuntu) provides a graphical user interface to access network settings under the\nSystem Settings\n>\nNetwork\noption. An option to set up proxies can be found there.\nYou can also use applications like dconf-editor to configure system wide proxy. You can also configure no_proxy settings using this application.\nCommand Line\nCommand line interface provides a quick way of updating your environment variables and thus your proxy settings. The proxy values are contained within the following variables -\nhttp_proxy\n,\nhttps_proxy\n,\nftp_proxy\n,\nsocks_proxy\n,\nno_proxy\n. One can update these values using a sample command shown below:\nexport http_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nThe variable\nno_proxy\ncontains those addresses for which the proxy access is disabled (useful for certain library websites, Moodle website, DC website etc.,). These settings, however, are not persistent through different login sessions and you must put these commands in your\n.bashrc\n(for\nbash\nshell) or\n.zshrc\n(for\nzsh\nshell) to be applied every time on shell startup.\nYou can also permanently export these settings to root environment settings by editing the\n/etc/environment\nfile. Open this file with\nsudo\npermission using your favorite text editor (\nvim\nfor example) and paste the following:\nhttp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nHTTP_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nhttps_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nHTTPS_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nFTP_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nftp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nno_proxy=127.0.0.0/8,::1,10.0.0.0/8\nSave and exit. The environment settings should now be always applied to your current environment. Verify this by checking the output of\nsudo env | grep proxy\n. It is, however, important to note that some applications might require their own proxy to be set up separately (\ngit\n, apt-get,\nwget\nfor example) and you must consult the appropriate man pages. To configure \"apt-get\" to use proxy add the following lines to \"/etc/apt/apt.conf\"\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nIn case you do not add the proxy options to root's environment, use the\n-E\nflag to ask\nsudo\nto preserve the existing environment variables. For example:\nsudo -E add-apt-repository \"deb\nhttp://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\nsaucy universe multiverse\"\nOS X\nGo to\nSystem Preferences\n>\nNetwork\n>\nSelect the appropriate service on the left (eg. WiFi)\n>\nAdvanced\n>\nProxies\n, and set both HTTP and HTTPS proxies.\nProxy bypass rules can be configured at the bottom.\niOS\nGo to\nSettings > Wi-Fi > Tap on the Wi-Fi network that you've connected to > Scroll down to HTTP Proxy > Set the server and port, and go back to the Wi-Fi screen for the settings to take effect.\nThere is no way to configure proxy bypass rules.\nRaspberry Pi\n1. For apt :\nNavigate to the following folder as follows:\ncd /etc/apt/apt.conf.d\nCreate a file called 10proxy:\nsudo nano 10proxy\nWithout authentication add these line:\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nWith Authentication add these line :\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"\nhttp://username:\n[email protected]\n:8080\n\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"\nhttp://username:\n[email protected]\n:8080\n\";\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy \"\nhttp://username:\n[email protected]\n:8080\n\";\n2. For everything else:\nEdit this file:\nsudo nano /etc/environment\nAdd these line :\nhttp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nHTTP_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nhttps_proxy=\nhttps://172.16.2.30:8080/\nHTTPS_PROXY=\nhttps://172.16.2.30:8080/\nFTP_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nftp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nno_proxy=127.0.0.0/8,::1,10.0.0.0/8\nAndroid\nSetting the HTTP proxy for WiFi on Android Lollipop.\nWhen connected to any of the mentioned access points, opening WiFi settings and long pressing the current WiFi network will give a\nModify Network\noption. Within this, scroll down and tick the\nProxy Server\ncheckbox and enter the IP address and port. This will allow you to use browser, play store and some other applications but\nWhatsApp\nand\nSkype\nwill not work.\nHowever, to use wifi for WhatsApp, Skype, messenger and other applications , you can use applications like Drony, Proxifier, Psiphon, DroidVPN etc. These apps are available in Play Store.\nAlso, it is to be noted that applications like Drony and Proxifier are proxy configuring app, they simply tunnel your whole internet traffic through a proxy server, in our case through IIT Kgp's proxy server whereas Psiphon and DroidVPN are VPN apps. The difference is that in former case , your internet requests are handled by IIT kgp's own server whereas in latter case an outside server handles your internet requests. Using internal server provides you privacy since your actual IP is \nAlso, speed wise Drony and Proxifier are better than Psiphon and DroidVPN. But the advantage of VPN apps over others is that you can access sites blocked by IIT Kgp like Torrents etc.\nIf the phone can be or is already rooted, applications like ProxyDroid and AutoProxy Lite may provide better experience. However, if you do not prefer to root your phone, use applications like DroidVPN, Psiphon or SurfEasy to configure proxy settings.\nWindows Phone\nGo to\nSettings > Wifi\nand touch on the required connection. It should give an option to setup the proxy.\nBypass\nThe proxy server does not route connections back inside the local subnet, but silently times out. To connect to a computer inside the KGP network, you need to bypass the proxy for that computer's IP, and make a direct connection. The following is a list of IPs and hostnames for which it is useful to bypass the proxy. An asterisk ( * ) or ( x ) represents any value.\nlocalhost and 127.0.0.1\nAll IPs in KGP's subnet – 10.x.x.x\n*.iitkgp.ernet.in\nIf you want to configure the\nno_proxy\nvariable, set it to\n10.0.0.0/8,127.0.0.0/8,::1\n.\nFor instructions on how to bypass the proxy for your OS or device, see\nSetup\n.\nWorkarounds\nKGP's proxies only allow HTTP connections on ports 80 and 443. This means that several much needed tools are broken behind the Great Fire Proxy. Depending on what you are trying to do, the following workarounds might be useful. These instructions are written with *nix based systems in mind, but equivalent alternatives for Windows can be found (often with same name).\nTor\ntor\nanonymises traffic, and has the useful side effect of convincing the proxy that we're making an HTTP connection.\nAs of September 2015, the institute is actively blocking tor connections, but bridge is not necessary to connect to tor.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\nBrowse the Internet through tor\nIf you only need to access websites through a browser, download the\nTor Browser Bundle\n, which provides a nice and easy to configure GUI setup and is available for Android, Linux, Mac, and Windows.\nSetting up tor in Android\nDownload Orbot from\nF-Droid\nor from\nPlay Store\nand install.\nGo to Settings > Select Outbound Proxy Type and enter HTTPS. Select Outbound Proxy Host and enter 172.16.2.30 Select Outbound Proxy Port and enter 8080.\nSelect 'Select Apps' option and tick those apps along with browsers whose traffic you want to route through tor.\nGo back to main screen and press Start. Swipe from right to left to see connection log. When connected, click on browse and choose a browser.\nTo stop tor press Stop and swipe from left to right and turn off 'Apps VPN Mode'\n(Optionally) download Orfox which is a tor browser for android and also if you want to surf onion websites.\nRun tor as a daemon\nSet up tor to run as a daemon on some port (eg. 9050). You can usually do this by installing tor using your distro's package manager (eg.\napt-get install tor\n).\nIn tor's config file (eg. /etc/tor/torrc), add\nHTTPSProxy <KGP proxy host>:<KGP proxy port>\n.\nTo make sure everything works, clear any existing HTTP or HTTPS proxy settings, and set your SOCKS proxy to use tor (eg. 127.0.0.1:9050). Go to\nhttps://check.torproject.org/\n, it should say that you're using tor.\nUsing tor to make the git protocol and OpenShift applications work (on Linux)\nDownload the\nTor Browser Bundle\nNavigate to the folder\n~/.ssh\nand edit the\nconfig\nfile. (You can create one if you don't have it already)\n$ cd ~/.ssh\n$ vim config\nAdd the following lines to the file to make the git protocol work:\n[\n3\n]\nHost github.com\n    User git\n    ProxyCommand connect -4 -S localhost:9050 $(tor-resolve %h localhost:9050) %p\nNow, run the following command after unzipping the downloaded archive of Tor:\n$ ./start-tor-browser.desktop\nNow, the git protocol should have started working.\nTo check this, you can run:\ngit clone\n[email protected]\n:metakgp/metakgp.git\nNote that for this to work properly, your SSH public key must be added to your GitHub account.\nIf it is not added [visit this guide on GitHub\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/\n]\nThis method can be used to get SSH access to OpenShift RedHat cloud applications as well, by appending to the config file:\nHost appname-domain.rhcloud.com\n    User rhcloud.com\n    ProxyCommand nc -x localhost:9150 %h %p\nReplace appname and domain in the above lines with the appropriate names from the OpenShift dashboard.\nTypically, an app that can be accessed at mentorship-gradescrapers.rhcloud.com has:\nURL: mentorship-gradescrapers.rhcloud.com\nappname: mentorship\ndomain: gradescrapers\nproxychains\nproxychains\ndoes TCP and DNS tunnelling through an HTTP server.\nSet up tor as outlined above.\nIn proxychains's config file (eg. ~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf), configure tor as a socks proxy (eg.\nsocks5 127.0.0.1 9050\n).\nNow, programs that make TCP connections on any port should work when run with proxychains. For example,\nproxychains git clone\ngit://example.com\n.\nProxyCap\nis a proxychains alternative for Windows and Mac.\nssh\nSee also:\nHow to SSH into a server that is outside the campus network\nOption 1 (recommended):\ncorkscrew\ntunnels ssh through an HTTP proxy. You need root access on the destination server for this to work.\nInstall corkscrew and in ~/.ssh/config, add the following line:\nProxyCommand <path to corkscrew> <proxy host> <proxy port> %h %p\n.\nOn the destination server, configure sshd to listen on port 443.\nPass in the\n-p 443\noption when running\nssh\n.\nOption 2: You can use proxychains + tor as outlined above. This will be slower, since the connection is routed through tor. However, it has the advantage of not needing to change the port sshd is listening on.\nssh-socks\nIf you have a remote machine that can listen on port 443 (as outline above), you can run a local socks proxy server on your machine to tunnel traffic through your remote machine. For example,\nssh -D 1080 -p 443 myserver.example.com\nwill start an SSH tunnel on port 1080, now you can use\n127.0.0.1:1080\nas a SOCKS proxy.\nOnline ssh clients\nOnline ssh clients are available to connect to remote server. An advantage of using this is that you do not need any extra softwares/configuration on your local computer or the server. Names of some of the websites are as follows :\nSerfish\n- A free AJAX SSH Client to quickly connect to remote server. (Registration not required)\nShiftedit\n- An online Web-based IDE with remote connection support. (Registration required)\nBanned websites\nOption 1: Use tor as outlined above.\nOption 2 (probably faster speeds): Set up a ssh-socks proxy.\ngit\nOption 1 (recommended): Check if there's an HTTPS version of the repo URL available, and use that if possible.\nOption 2: Use proxychains and tor as outlined above.\nOption 3: Use corkscrew for cloning, pushing, pulling using SSH instead of HTTPS (This avoids the requirement of having to enter username and password each time.)\nHost github.com\n   Hostname ssh.github.com\n   Port 443\n   ProxyCommand corkscrew 172.16.2.30 8080 %h %p\nOption 4: Override ssh settings to force use of port 443 instead of 22 for github.com. Ref:\n[1]\nHost\ngithub.com\nHostname\nssh.github.com\nPort\n443\nUser\ngit\nheroku\nOption 1 (recommended): Running commands on the command line of your heroku instance is not possible. Say you want to apply new migrations on a Ruby on Rails app, then, instead of running:\nheroku run rake db:migrate\nyou can run:\nheroku run:detached rake db:migrate\nThis will run the command (rake db:migrate, in this particular case) on the remote machine, and give another command which can be used to view the logs. The output of this command is similar to:\nRunning `rake db:migrate` detached... up, run.8799\nUse `heroku logs -p run.8799 -a app-name` to view the output.\nOption 2: Use proxychains and tor as outlined above.\nUDP\nHTTP Tunneling is a way of encapsulating UDP packets in HTTPS protocol. Currently the tor network does not support UDP. However, you can use VPNs to tunnel UDP traffic.\nInstall OpenVPN. For windows, there is a convenient GUI app.\nGo to OpenVPN settings and set HTTP proxy\n172.16.2.30:8080\n.\nGet .conf file for an openvpn server. vpngate.net has some free servers, be careful to download TCP conf., and only for servers open on port 443. Paid VPNs with stable connections are also available if you look for them.\nRun OpenVPN GUI as administrator (windows) and add KGP proxy. Load the .conf file you downloaded. This should create a new TUN/TAP device, and internet should now work without a proxy.\nThe connection will be flaky if using vpngate servers. Don't expect to be able to play online games this way, since tunneling would delay your UDP packets too much to get a good ping, even with stable VPN servers.\nsshuttle\nsshuttle\nis more easy and powerful over normal ssh socks tunneling for many reasons :-\nApp don't need to use a socks proxy\nClient don't need to have root access on remote machine\nYou don't want to create an ssh port forward for every single host/port on the remote network.\nIt's very simple to use. sshuttle requires\ncorkscrew\nfor tunneling. Steps :-\n$ git clone\nhttps://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle\nConfigure\ncorkscrew\ninside\n~/.ssh/config\n. A line in the file should be something like\nProxyCommand corkscrew 172.16.2.30 8080 %h 443\nStart sshuttle by navigating inside the cloned directory and running\n./sshuttle --dns -r username@sshserver 0.0.0.0/0 -vv\nRemove all the proxy settings whatsoever from browser, applications, `/etc/environment`, etc. i.e. use Direct Connection.\nsshuttle catches every tcp connection and routes it through the ssh server.\nnvm\nnvm\n(node version manager) is used to download, compile and install node.\nTo set proxy for nvm, use the following commands:\nexport http_proxy=172.16.2.30:8080\nexport https_proxy=172.16.2.30:8080\nexport NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=\nhttps://nodejs.org/dist\nnpm\nnpm\nis a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js\nTo set proxy for npm :-\nnpm config set proxy\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\nnpm config set https-proxy\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\nCloud Computing Services\nSeveral cloud computing services and VPS providers are now available for circumvention. Digital Ocean, Amazon EC2, Vultr, Google Compute Engine are some of the popular providers.\nStreisand\nis a convenient one-click solution to create an IPSec secured personal VPN based on the default L2TP/IP protocol. This protocol is supported by default on Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and several other operating systems.\nDigital Ocean\nis a cloud computing service, which provides SSH access to droplets in their data centers. Digital Ocean doesn't have a free plan, but credit of $50 can be obtained by signing up for the\nGitHub Student Developer Pack\n. (All currently enrolled students of the institute are eligible.) Further, Digital Ocean requires a Credit Card to be added as payment method (Credit/Debit card is only take as a payment method. You will not be charged anything on setting up the account, provided you are using student pack), or a $5 remittance\nthrough PayPal to get the account started.\nOnce the account can create droplets, droplets may be used for things such as SOCKS proxies, torrenting content through Command Line torrent clients (such as\ntorrent\n), or as an OpenVPN\nserver.\nHistory\nBefore the load balancer proxy was introduced, several proxies could be configured. These proxies had different speeds and availabilities at different times. Some of the older proxies were:\n144.16.192.247\n144.16.192.245\n144.16.192.217\n144.16.192.218\n10.3.100.209\n10.3.100.210\n10.3.100.211\n10.3.100.212\nIn 2014, students were instructed to use a single load balancer proxy.\n[\n4\n]\nThe other proxies no longer work.\nPublic IPs\nThe outside world sees one of the following IPs as your IP when you make any network request. This public IP is converted to an internal IP (which is what you see as your machine's IP) by the proxy server using\nNAT\n. You may need to whitelist these IPs if setting up an external web service that is frequently accessed from campus.\n203.110.246.22 (as of 11 August 2015)\n203.110.246.23 (as of 2 September 2015)\n203.110.243.23 (as of 12 August 2015)\n203.110.242.20 (as of 7 September 2017)\n203.110.242.7  (as of 25 April 2018)\nYou can see your current public IP at\nhttp://www.whatsmyip.org/\n.\nIt is important to know this because any activity done by you gets logged with these IPs and corresponds to the name of the institution. For example, if you make an anonymous edit to Wikipedia, it will be logged under these public IPs, and hence any disruptive behavior by single person might lead to an IP ban and unavailability of resources for everyone inside the campus. It's advisable to create an account for such activities wherever possible, or use one of the workarounds suggested in initial sections.\nSee Also\nInternet and LAN\nHow to SSH into a server that is outside the campus network\nHiT Hi FiT Hai\nDC\nExternal Links\nSet up apt-get to use a http-proxy\nnpm proxy setting\nTop free VPNs\nReferences\n↑\nVerified\nby\nCic\non September 9, 2015.\n↑\nVerified\nby\nrandomkgp\non October 15, 2017.\n↑\nVerified\nby\nIcyflame\non 2015-09-25.\n↑\n\"TSG Facebook post instructing students to use the load balancer proxy\"\n.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Institute_proxies&oldid=146458\n\""

The society used to publish the monthly wall magazine\nHang On\n, and the literary newsletter\nKGP Pulse\nbut they have been discontinued in favour of using social media to reach a larger population. TLS continues to publish the annual campus magazine\nAlankar\n.\nCampus Events\nKavya Sandhya\nIn the year 2014-15 a new event was introduced by TLS on the lines of a\nKavi Sammelan,\nchristened\nKavya Sandhya\n. The first edition was primarily experimental in nature, with the Hindi poets from Team TLS exhibiting their poetry and oratory skills on stage. the event received great admiration from the\nkavi\ns in the campus and that motivated us to bring it in a larger scale as the\nKavyanjali. Kavya Sandhya\nis held till date in the autumn semester and gives a chance for the Hindi poets of the campus to dazzle the audience with their words.\nKavyanjali\nContinuing the legacy of Kavya Sandha, during the spring semester of year 2014-15 TLS collaborated with\nAwaaz\nand\nRajbhasha Vibhag\nto organize\nKavyanjali\nin the\nKalidas auditorium\nwhere acclaimed Hindi poets like Prof. Prem Shankar Tripathi, Shri Ravi Pratap Singh, Shri Jagesh Tiwari presided the event. Since then,\nKavyanjali\nis held annually in the spring semester where poets from outside and as well as inside the KGP campus enrapture the audience with their lines.\nPoetry Slam\nIn the year 2014-15, for the first time, TLS hosted a Poetry slam event during Spring fest. The event saw participation from 6 colleges and it was open for both Hindi and English poets.\nFarrago\nIn the year 2018-19, for the first time, an English spoken word event called\nFarrago\nwas conducted. The event was held to promote the culture of English spoken word. The event saw participation from TLS members as well as some exceptional poets outside TLS from the campus.\nOnline Presence\nTLS regularly publishes content from its\nFacebook page\n. Seeing the growing popularity of the social media platform Instagram, TLS also made its debut on Instagram and started regularly publishing from its\nInstagram page\nsince 2019.\nHistory\nWhile the exact year is unknown, Technology Literary Society is believed to be founded sometime in the 50s\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n, along with\nHindi Technology Dramatics Society\nin the same year which makes it one of the first societies in KGP. TLS was previously responsible for conducting KGP's literary fest, called\nManzar\nand publishing the annual campus magazine,\nAlankar\n. Manzar was conducted in the week following\nSpring Fest\n, another one of KGP's long standing traditions. But when\nKshitij\nwas started in 2002, the time slots for Spring Fest and\nManzar\nwere merged, both being in the socio-cultural arena. In those days, SF did not conduct literary events. When the time slots for Manzar and SF were merged, logistical problems arose between SF and TLS teams, both competing for time slots and venues. Then TLS was broken in 2 parts, one responsible for Manzar to be merged with SF, another to be responsible for Alankar\nHowever, TLS kept the its tradition the same, keeping 9 Governors (which made sense while they had to conduct a fest). This was a period of decline for TLS as it had no responsibility other than to publish\nAlankar\nat the end of the year. However, it maintained its 9 Governors.\nIn the year 2008, TLS came up with a new publication -\nHang On\n, a monthly wall magazine which would be a satirical depiction of events around KGP and the world. Hang On was meant to be mostly humorous in nature while the more serious pieces were kept for ALANKAR. In 2009, TLS founded another bi-monthly publication -\nKGP Pulse\nwhich would frequent the more \"literary\" pursuits of its members and students from KGP but these were discontinued in 2016. In 2010, TLS for the first time started conducting events along with Spring Fest, which can be seen till date. In the same year, 2010, Alankar was not published due to Gymkhana budget constraints. It was, however, revived after a gap of 3 years in 2012 and since then has been published every year.\nFrom the year 2010-11, there have been only 4 Governors in TLS every year.\nThere has also been a longstanding debate over what TLS stands for. While some within the team claim that it is to promote literary activities in the campus, some feel that it stands to promote the literary activities among the members. This has been reflected over the years in the change in leadership as each leadership team has their own version of the motive of TLS and acts accordingly. However, TLS has always stood by it's core principle and it's motto - helping KGP to express themselves!\nGovernors\nList of Governors\n2024-25\nAmitesh Kumar (HS '26)\nShivam (GG '26)\nVidya Niwas Mishra (EE '27)\n2023-24\nAmrita Ghosh (ME '26)\nDeovardhan (GG '25)\nIndra Kumar Gupta (AE '25)\nMaithili Bhuyar (EE '26)\nVaishnavi Nikam (ME '25)\n2022-23\nPranay Pandey (PH '25)\nNishita Singh (BT '25)\nShreya Gupta (HS '25)\nTanmay Malatkar (IM '24)\nMehak Sharma (ME '24)\n2021-22\nAditi Sisodia (NA '24)\nApurav Tambe (NA '24)\nShalmali Sriram (AR '24)\nUmang Pandey (ME '23)\n2020-21\nSarvesh Deshpande (ME '23)\nArchi Banerjee (PH '23)\nKshitij Anand (AE '23)\nUtkarsh Agrawal (MF '22)\n2019-20\nKushal Patankar (MT '21)\nPankhuri Saxena (HS '22)\nPranav Shukla (CE '22)\nPrem Shankar (HS '22)\n2018-19\nYash Shukla (MI '21)\nAditya Prakash (IM '21)\nAkshit Lonare (EE '20)\nSourav Garg (EC '21)\n2017-18\nShreshth Khare(CH'19)\nAayush Keshva(PH'20)\nSwapnil Batle(MA'20)\nAshutosh Bhaskar(GG'20)\n2016-17\nLalit Khemlani (EC '18)\nHimanshu Mishra (MA '19)\nNitish Kumar (CE '18)\nPankaj Sutar (HS '19)\n2015-16\nYash Shrivastava (CS '17)\nRishabh Upadhyay (CY '18)\nSumit Kumar Pandey (MI '17)\nAtchuta Srinivas Duddu (IE '17)\n2014-15\nUjjwal Dubey (CH '16)\nHardik Rajpal (PH '17)\nTriyansha Vijayvargiya (GG '17)\nShailesh Kumar(GG '17)\n2013-14\nPragya Sharma (EE '15)\nNidhi Dwivedi (HS '16)\nSushruta Mishra (ME '15)\nKetan Mundhada (AR '16)\n2012-13\nRahul Jai Singh (ME '15)\nPriya Singh (CH '14)\nVikas Dubey (IM '15)\nSaif Khan (CY '15)\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nArchives\n↑\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150515065840/http://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/societies\n↑\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20131121043239/http://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/societies/tls\n↑\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20120912043025/http://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/societies/tls\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Technology_Literary_Society&oldid=238547\n\""

Current understanding of the\nbiophysics of computation is completely different from the field of artificial\nneural networks. The course covers the very basics of the biology involved in\nneuronal processing up to understanding how neurons encode sensory\ninformation and how such information is decoded in the brain. Further the\ncourse covers phenomena of learning and plasticity of neuronal circuits. Overall\nthe course will equip students to provide different ways of solving problems\nrelated to learning using biologically plausible solutions and also allow\ninterested candidates to take up research in neuroscience, a highly\ninterdisciplinary field and contribute in areas of brain machine interface, neural\nprosthetics, biological sensors and many others.\nText Book\nTheoretical Neuroscience - Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Neural\nSystems by Peter Dayan and L.F.

The course starts with understanding brain at neuronal level and moves to understanding firing patterns. Professor does an amazing job in explaining things from scratch, assuming no prerequisites. Even basics of MATLAB can be picked up after taking the course. Students without much mathematical background can also complete the course by putting enough time and effort. Take this course if you are interested to learn about workings of human brain. But expect most of the stuff will be mathematical and computational, rather than biological.\nRegarding load, since the projects are exhaustive, they consume a lot of time.\nTime Table\nThis course has empty slot in ERP - Classes are to be conducted after 6 PM on weekdays and classes can also be on weekends. Generally, two 1.5-hour duration classes are held during the weekdays to cover the core content of the course and one 1-hour class during the weekends to cover required mathematical background.\nWEDNESDAY - 6:30pm to 8:00pm\nTHURSDAY - 7:00pm to 8:30pm\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=EC60007:_Computational_Neuroscience&oldid=235633\n\""
