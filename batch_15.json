It was conceived as a platform for the students of IIT Kharagpur to showcase their extra academic skills. Over the years, it began to attract  participants from the neighboring colleges of West Bengal. In the last decade or so, the fest grew manifold in scale, attracting participants from all over India and as well as abroad. The 2015 edition of the fest received a footfall of over 50,000 people.\nActivities\nDuring the fest, students from IIT Kharagpur and from different colleges all over the country participate in a multitude of social and cultural activities.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\nThe ambit of the events encompasses various genres like Dance, Music, Dramatics, Photography, Literature, Quizzing and Fine Arts.\n[\n9\n]\nTremendous participation and aggressive competition are seen in all the events, especially the flagship events of SF, namely - Nukkad, Shuffle, Wildfire, Rangmanch, Centrifuge, Lake Side Dreams, etc. The preliminary rounds of Nukkad, Shuffle and Wildfire happen nationwide. Every city that Spring Fest visits to conduct prelims, the whole atmosphere turns festive and the creative lot throng to the venue to see the show of talent.\nOther non-competition based events include\nHard-Talk\nwhich involves talks/conferences by eminent personalities from a variety of fields and IIT KGP Model United Nations, one of the biggest MUNs that take place in Eastern India. The number of these events is particularly large and serves to cater to the very large number of participants — both local as well as from other colleges all over the country.\nThe hub for major activities during the fest is called the\nArena\n, which has the\nInformals\nand\nPerpz\nstage. The informals stage hosts various fun filled casual activities, for which the participants can win numerous prizes. The Perpz stage is an all day dance floor with a DJ, that attracts huge crowds. Apart from this the arena also has numerous food and corporate stalls.\nPro Nites\nThe evenings are notable for the \"Pro-Nights\", more commonly known as\nStar-Nites\n— the biggest events in Spring Fest which usually involve live concerts by some of the most famous musicians and bands of national and international acclaim. All the Star Nites are free to attend for any student of the institute and all registered participants. The genres of music are wide and varied and involve pop, rock and fusion bands. The venue for these events is the\nTagore Open Air Theater\n(TOAT) and\nJnan Ghosh Stadium\nwhich usually get packed to their full capacity during the\nStar-Nites\n, with crowds of up to 23,000 people.

A plethora of more than 60 events ranging from varied genres provides a platform to the students where they can prove their mettle and caliber. With a myriad of fun and intellectually stimulating events, huge star nights every year and a versatile crowd profile, Spring Fest has gradually consolidated its position as the premier inter-collegiate fest. The fierce competitions, uninterrupted entertainment, breath-taking pro-shows, and something to suit everybody is what gives SF its magnificence.\nThe fest has three national level events-\nWildfire\n- the national level rock band competition,\nShuffle\n- the street dance competition and\nNukkad\n- the street play competition. Wildfire attracts registrations from hundreds of bands and prizes in the 2014 edition were worth more than 4 lakh INR. Most of the socio-cultural activities are day events which involve dramatics, music, dance competitions, fine-arts contests, quizzes, gaming and other literary events. Judges of the competitions are reputed and famous personalities from different fields and organisations. One notable event is\nModel United Nations\nwhich is an academic simulation of the United Nations Organization where participants take on the  role of representatives of countries/organizations in a UN council, discussing world  issues.\nCentrifuge\n, the inter-collegiate dance event is arguably the most keenly followed event of the fest. The other notable events are\nRangmanch\n, the inter-collegiate Dramatics event,\nSargam\n, the eastern musical jamming competition and\nMary Bucknell Trophy\n, the prestigious quiz competition.\nNotable Guests\nEvery year many esteemed personalities of different fields from around the country are invited as guests and judges for different events and competitions.

        "content": "Touch Left and Touch Right\nis an online campaign inspired on the format of R U OK? day aimed at increasing interaction and face to face communication among the students in the community. The event urged students to come out and interact with friends in their neighboring rooms.\n[\n1\n]\nBackground\nThe event was inspired in wake of a tragic suicide of a fourth year student from Nehru Hall of Residence,\n[\n2\n]\nunfortunately the fourth such tragedy of 2017.\n[\nunverified\n]\nPreviously, a similar event called\nReach Out Week\nwas organized with similar ideas.\nDetails\nThe Facebook event was hosted by the\nCounselling Center\n, IIT Kharagpur page and a Facebook event was created from April 23 to April 29.\n[\n1\n]\nThe post mentions:\nA boarder of the wing has to check his next rooms' boarders in left and right, several times a day regarding 'R U Ok'? Is there life is going alright? Not necessarily things has to be\nalright but each and everybody should know that there are people to whom they really matters. Mutual exchange of worldly concerns, are what is highly encouraged.\nYou physically go and check, have a soulful chat. Let us know in our survey link here how many times a day you are actually able to dedicate your service to the fellow student. If you find something unusual with you or your next door neighbor, please do not hesitate to call us or email us immediately.\nLet's make this campaign a great success. With each knock on the next door our IIT KGP will regain it's habitual warmth and Care.\nOn 22nd April, Director sent out an email in the evening to everyone with the following message:\nDear Students,\nTragedy has struck us again and we have lost another life in the most unfortunate manner. We are all plunged in sadness. Like in the previous incident, in this case also, we are unable to determine any valid reason for taking such a drastic step. Even close friends, co-worker groups, teachers and thesis supervisor are unable to fathom a cause. Yet it is difficult to imagine one going for such an act unless there is some deep difficulty within. That even closest people here could not gauge this is something about which we are very very concerned.\nWe all need to come together at this time when we are all heartbroken to ensure that we care for each other. There is a need for direct connect and bonding. We need to properly address this crisis while we implement long-term plans. We are in the middle of end-term examinations. I am therefore requesting everyone to take a little bit of your time every day during the next seven days to reach out and meet with your wing mates and friends at some designated hour (say 7 pm for 10 minutes before you go for dinner) to see if everyone is okay.\nIf anyone of you feels uncomfortable, please seek help immediately from faculty, friends, staff or anyone you know.  If you feel anyone else needs help, please report the same to someone in the hall, department or administration. The institute administration, wardens, hall / gymkhana office bearers, faculty, staff, counselling centre, hospital, security, are available to help you. Please spread the message that giving and taking help is the best solution to such situations.\nMany suggestions are being received by us and we are looking at them carefully though we may not be able to reply to each one at this moment. I thank everyone who has come out to assist during this period.\nLet reaching out and personal (not only digital) bonding be our way of remembrance of the lives lost. Let us resolve to passionately communicate that this is not a way to end any problem we face. Let us work together to help each other to try and ensure that we never face a similar situation again.\nI seek your kind cooperation.\nRegards\nPPC\nReferences\n↑\n1.0\n1.1\n\"Touch Left Touch Right\"\n.

        "content": "Gopali Youth Welfare Society\ncommonly abbreviated as\nGYWS\nis a government-registered NGO in West Bengal and aims to improve the living standards of people in Gopali village. The organisation was started in 2002 and registered on 20 April 2005 under the West Bengal Societies Registration Act, 1961.  It is mainly run by the students of IIT Kharagpur with the help of professors of IIT Kharagpur and local citizens of Gopali village. It mainly focuses on Child education along with Women Empowerment, Eradicating Child Labor among many other causes.\nThe organisation has initiated several programs of free education, social awareness campaigns and vocational training.\nHistory\nThe organisation was started in 2002 by Mrinal Kanti Bhanja, and registered on 20 April 2005 under the West Bengal Societies Registration Act, 1961. It is mainly run by the students of IIT Kharagpur with the help of professors of IIT Kharagpur and local citizens of Gopali village. Jagriti Vidya Mandir was started in the year 2008 in a rented campus, and was shifted to a permanent campus in the year 2012. LIGHT, the pan- India expansion initiative of the socity, was started in the year 2017.\nInitiatives\nJagriti Vidya Mandir\nMarking illiteracy as its prime concern, GYWS embarked on an education program in April 2008: Jagriti Vidya Mandir, an English Medium primary school. Its main motto is \"not to make the children literate, but to make them educated.\nFoundation Day:\nIt is conducted in the month August every year. Members of GYWS conduct events and various competitions for the children.\nTeachers’ Day:\nWe celebrate Teachers’ Day in our school to show our respect to our teachers and to make our students know the importance of teachers in life.\nSports Day:\nIt is the annual sports meet conducted in our school. It is conducted in the month of October.\nRepublic Day:\nSpeech by the chief guest, flag hoisting followed by the performances of the children takes place.\nAashayein:\nIt is the Annual day celebration of our school in which the students of JVM come and perform in IIT KGP so that they get a broad platform. Generally, it takes place in the month of March.\nPrayas\nSkill development\n: Under this initiative, our objective is to impart skills to the youth first so that they can become an earning hand for their family.In this program, we train and develop educated but unemployed youth in line with industry requirements and provide them employment opportunities.\nLive Project\n: Live Project is the channel to put the budding managers on the track of social work. The project involves in selecting the potential candidates from the various institutions giving them the liberty to work on a problem and expanding the scope of the work.\nGreenovation:\nIt is an ambitious project aimed at introducing low cost and organic farming techniques to farmers of nearby areas of kharagpur. School children are also involved so that they can develop  interest in agriculture.\nUdyat\nUnder Teacher Training ,the PG and RS students try to help the teachers to improve their ability to teach.The students of JVM are taught how to operate computers in this initiative.We plan to extend this initiative for the students of other schools too.A weekly Science based fun activity has been conducted in Jagriti Vidya Mandir. Objective is to bring gleams in the eyes of children while learning in school. The students conduct sessions to project curious science and textbook fundamentals in an Involved manner.Along with the regular school, JVM students are also taught on Sundays.They are motivated to study hard and also are given coaching for JNV entrance test.\nLiGHT\nLiving In Greater Horizons Together. After the success of strategies and plans of the Gopali Youth Welfare Society (GYWS) near the area of IIT Kharagpur, the society planned to reciprocate similar models of social upliftment throughout the nation.LIGHT currently has four centers-Bhopal(MP), Gaya(Bihar), Kancheepuram(Tamil Nadu), Samvedana(Maharashtra).\nOther Initiatives\nPaperkraft\nAimed ‘ Generating Employment, Preserving Environment and empowering women ‘ , As part of this project, students volunteer to collect old newspapers from the Halls of Residences of IIT Kharagpur. These are given to poor rural women, free of charge, to make into ‘thongas’ or paper bags. Currently 30 women are associated with the production process who were given a week long training to make thongas.\nPaperKraft thus provides an opportunity to the destitute women to become self-employed. Also it promotes a cleaner and greener environment as it recycles degradable waste materials into something and also provides a viable substitute to plastic bags which are non-biodegradable. Thus PaperKraft is a sustainable, employment-generating, and environment friendly.\nKGP BloodConnect (K.B.C.)\nK.B.C.\n[\n1\n]\nis an initiative started by Gopali Youth Welfare Society &\nStudent Welfare Group -IIT Kharagpur\n.\nIt was realised by us that whenever there is a requirement of blood, many people are willing to donate blood but due to some or the other reasons communication gap becomes their barrier and as a result prompt help doesn't reach to the patient which is very essential in case of an emergency .\nK.B.C.  can become a sailing medium of contact for the donor and patient and this particularly is our motto along with spreading awareness about blood donation behind starting such a program.\nK.B.C. is also associated with '\nKharagpur Voluntary Blood Donor Organisation (KVBDO)'\nand have contacted the local hospitals of Kharagpur including Kharagpur Railway Hospital.\nIt's not that K.B.C is only for the students but it will benefit local people in and around Kharagpur.\nPedals for Progress\nSome of the kids need to travel long distances to come to school and then go back again. Owing to these hectic travel, GYWS initially booked a Cab to supplement their requirements. But the cab has been unable to reach out every child because of which students either walk down the road or their parents have to go with them. So, GYWS members collect bicycles from passing out IIT Kharagpur students, repairs them and gives them to the JVM children. In this way, children coming from far off places can travel comfortably.\nActivities\nYogdaan\nYogdaan is an initiative taken by GYWS in which the members go door to door of each and every student of IIT Kharagpur campus and request them for donation for their school construction project.Since last 3 years they have been doing yogdaan annually and have been getting a very good response from them every year. With the wholehearted support from students in the very first year of yogdaan, GYWS had bought land for school construction, and from the fund of next yogdaan, two classrooms had been completed there and from last year's yogdaan fund, the work is in progress currently, and the good news is that school has been started in new campus.\nSpring Fest Stall\nWhile everyone gets busy enjoying during the glamorous\nSpring Fest\n, GYWS Members in turn look after the stall which is majorly prepared to promote the activities and partially to collect funds  for the betterment of the children.\nAnnual Day\nLike every other school, JVM also celebrates Annual Day, which has been named Aashayein, with full flair. First Annual Day was held in 2009. Support by advisory committee and presence of dignitaries which includes\nDirector, IIT Kharagpur Prof. Partha Pratim Chakraborty\nhas helped GYWS & JVM celebrate annual days without any serious concern with limited monetary resources.\nObjectives\nTaking part in promoting education for the children belonging to destitute families.\nMaking people aware of the rights, duties and responsibilities as an individual, a villager, a citizen.\nProviding preventive, promotive and curative health care services for the people in general and women and children in specific.\nEmpowering the rural women through microfinance and Self Help Group(PAPERKRAFT).\nImparting vocational training for rural youth with a view to making them self – supportive and acquiring skill suited to their needs.\nTo give emphasize on food security of the community as well as right to safe drinking water and healthy sanitation.\nTo provide support to the vulnerable person materially and emotionally.\nTo initiate an appropriate early childhood development and rehabilitation of the children with disabilities including older persons.\nDevelopment of micro – level infra structural facilities.\nPromotion of local resources to function as self-sustaining development units.\nIntegration of crop cultivation, agri – horticulture, agro – forestry, livestock rearing and fish culture and increase their production.\nBuilding confidence among the target groups to create their own resources and recycle those in sequential manner for sustainability.\nEradication of Child Labour\nMedia Recognition\nGYWS is being recognized by various media and prominent personalities for the noble work done by the group. Following are the testimonials for the organization in recent past -\nIITians run school to bridge social divide - The Times Of India\n[\n2\n]\nIITians take education beyond Hallowed Campus - The Telegraph\n[\n3\n]\nDainik Bhaskar\n[\n4\n]\nPratidin\n[\n5\n]\nAppreciation from Mr. Roy Da Silva, President of IIT Foundation\n[\n6\n]\nReferences\n↑\nK.B.C.\n↑\nThe Times of India\n↑\nThe telegraph\n↑\nDainik Bhaskar\n↑\nPratidin\n↑\nRoy Da Silva, President of IIT Foundation\nAnnual report 13-14\nAudit report 13-14\nExternal Links\nGopali Youth Welfare Society Official Website\nGopali Youth Welfare Society Facebook Page\nGopali Youth Welfare Society Linked Profile\nGopali Youth Welfare Society Google Plus Profile\nGopali Youth Welfare Society Twitter Handle\nGopali Youth Welfare Society Youtube channel\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Gopali_Youth_Welfare_Society&oldid=146264\n\""

        "content": "Overview\nSHARE is an innovative, student-led organization that bridges academic knowledge with real-world consulting to generate meaningful impact. It empowers high-potential university students with practical skills, preparing them to become socially responsible, results-driven leaders who add value to both businesses and society. With a proven track record in international case competitions and hands-on experience across diverse sectors including technology, consulting, and sustainable development SHARE’s teams consistently deliver creative, effective, and actionable strategies that transcend conventional solutions.\nServices\nSHARE offers a comprehensive range of services, including the development of strategies for market entry, geographic expansion, and the identification of new market opportunities. The team conducts in-depth analysis of market trends and customer insights to design pricing strategies aligned with product value propositions. Additionally, SHARE supports clients by creating business plans, identifying potential investors, and crafting compelling pitch presentations. Their expertise also extends to data analytics, insight generation, and delivering tailored recommendation plans.\nStructure\nSelections\nSHARE conducts its recruitment process at the beginning of the autumn semester, which includes a group discussion followed by a personal interview. Candidates are evaluated not on their prior knowledge of consulting, strategy, or market research, but on their ability to think critically, approach problems logically, and communicate ideas clearly and coherently.\nThe evaluation emphasizes structured thinking, analytical problem-solving, and a strong sense of commitment. SHARE seeks individuals who can manage their time effectively and demonstrate a high level of professionalism within the team.\nLearning Culture\nAt SHARE, the primary mode of learning for first-year students is through knowledge meetings, where senior members lead sessions to introduce and explain essential consulting functions such as market research, strategy development, pricing analysis, and data-driven decision-making. These sessions not only facilitate learning but also foster active discussions and strengthen relationships between peers and senior members.\nSHARE further enhances experiential learning through intra-team competitions specifically designed for first-year students. These include a traditional case study challenge, an equity research report, and a distinctive event called\nBid to Pitch\n. In\nBid to Pitch\n, participants begin by conceptualizing a startup idea and delivering a brief pitch to their peers. After the pitches, teams bid on the ideas they find most promising, effectively \"purchasing\" one to develop further. They then transform the chosen concept into a comprehensive, real-world business plan and deliver a final presentation that simulates an actual product or company launch. These initiatives are crafted to cultivate creativity, strategic thinking, and collaboration in a dynamic, hands-on environment.\nEvents\nCase Study Competition\n: To develop critical thinking and business acumen, first-year students examine and offer strategic answers to real-world problems that businesses face.\nBid to Pitch\n: In order to foster entrepreneurial thinking and valuation skills, participants bid on startup ideas and pitch business models, simulating investment decisions.\nEquity Research Report\n: Students gain experience with financial analysis and stock evaluation by creating expert-caliber equity research reports on publicly traded companies.\nOrganizational Hierarchy\nAdvisors\nare the senior-most members of SHARE, typically in their fourth or fifth year. They draw upon their extensive experience to provide strategic guidance and help shape the overall direction of the organization.\nPresidents\nare third-year students who lead and manage key projects across SHARE, ensuring that all initiatives are aligned with the organization’s goals and vision.\nManagers\n, in their second year, are responsible for executing project portfolios and overseeing daily operations. They also play a crucial role in coordinating knowledge meetings and organizing internal competitions.\nAssociates\nare first-year students who support project work assigned by senior team members.

Most common applications are in minimizing effort or cost, and maximizing output. Optimization Techniques are divided into two different types, namely Linear Models and Non-Linear Models. The mathematical statement of a linear model is stated as follows:\nFind <math> x_1, x_2, x_3,..., x_n </math> so as to\n<math>max/min : Z = \\sum_{j=0}^{n} c_j x_j, j=1,2,3...n </math>\nSubject to the conditions :\n<math>\\sum_{j=0}^{n} a_{ij} x_j (\\le,=,\\ge) b_i, i=1,2,3...m </math>\n<math> x_j\\ge0, j=1,2,3,...,n</math>\nGraphical Method\nBasic Feasible Solution Method\nSimplex Method\nBig-M Method\nTwo Phase Method\nDual Simplex Method\nTheorems\nClassroom resources\nSuggested reference books\nAdditional Resources\n↑\n1.0\n1.1\nVerified\nby\nNuwanda\non 2016-02-16.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=MA30014:_Operation_Research&oldid=25465\n\""

        "content": "Data Analytics (GC)\nGC Type\nTechnology\nCup\nStrategy Cup\nEvent Type\nTeam\nPoints\n50\nIn the Data Analytics General Championship event each participating hall has to\nanalyze a given data set to solve the corresponding problem statement. Data Analytics as a GC event was started in 2014. Participating halls have to submit\ntheir results and a report within the deadline, which is usually ten days after the day on which problem statement is given.\n2015-2016\nThis edition of the Data Analytics General Championship saw a lot of controversy.\nThe first problem statement was released on 10th January  2016. The problem statement came from a company called Abzooba and had three sub-parts. The first one was to create a recommender system from a data of search query by a user on an e-commerce, the resulting product shown and the feedback given by the user. The second problem statement was to rank a set of documents based on a search query. The third was a link to a problem on Kaggle, which had already been closed and its solutions were available. The first problem came with a small dataset of 81 entries and there was no data given for the second one. The sub committee meeting unanimously decided to scrape the third problem statement. Since getting people to do grunt work is not a hard task some halls pointed out that the first and second problem statement can be solved by manually ranking document and giving the feedback on the queries. The committee decided to have a Skype meeting with the problems setters and simultaneously pursue other companies for additional problem statements. The VoIP meeting never happened and there was some confusion regarding fact if the sub problem statement one has been scrapped. The next subcommittee meeting, after a long debate decided to scrape both the remaining problem statements. After this, Gymkhana representatives contacted the next company on the priority list ‘Absolute Data’ with some guidelines decided by all the halls to avoid the complications in the Problem Statement but due to large no. of guidelines, company was not able to give the Problem Statement in required time scale. Meanwhile, Gymkhana told that they already had a Problem Statement from Abzooba which came for Open IIT and it was closed till now. Then after waiting for 3 days, on 18th January all halls decided to release the Problem Statement from Abzooba. This time problem statement (Predicting Demographic Information of a Facebook User with Specified Degree of Uncertainty) was very good but again the only problem was no data. Each hall sent some queries regarding problem statement and we got the reply this time but it was too vague to work on. The company refused to sent any data. Again, all halls agreed to scrap the problem statement.\nThe next problem statement came from a company called Quanta, it was expected that Quanta will give a \"good\" problem statement because it was the problem setter for the event of 2014-2015. The problem statement was to rate the vendors of Flipkart or Amazon. In further clarifications the company clarified that they have no data, no judging criteria, no testing data or accuracy criteria. They said the submissions will be judged only on the \"soundness\" of the model given in the submitted report.\n2014-2015: Electricity Theft Detection\nThe problem statement for 2014 was to detect possible fraudulent customers given the data collected by a power distribution company. The given data\nincluded:\nUsage Data: The billing details having the monthly usage in units and the bill generated for each consumer.\nTechnical Data: Information about different types of transformers and the meters.\nHourly Load Data: information on hour-wise load data on the meters and metrics like transformer ratio and meter factor.\nCustomer Data: Information on the consumers’ address, the transformer and meter details he is connected to. It also gives an idea of the sanctioned load on his meter. A few indicators of customer profile are also provided.\nComplaint Data: The complaint details provided information on complaints filed by consumers. It contained the date of the complaint, the reason for the complaint, and the consumer who came up with the complaint.\nCustomer Payment Data: Information on the payment dates and payment amounts for customers.

        "content": "Google Summer of Code\nGoogle Summer of Code Logo\nFounded\n2005\nBegins\nApril – May\nEnds\nAugust - October\nWebsite\nhttps://summerofcode.withgoogle.com\nThe\nGoogle Summer of Code\n(\nGSoC\n) is an international online program focused on bringing new contributors into\nopen source software development\n. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a programming project under the guidance of mentors. Stipends of upto\nUS$3,000\n(as of 2023) are awarded to students who successfully complete a proposed free and open-source software development project during the summer. Google has introduced multiple sized projects (\n90\n,\n175\nand\n350\nhours). As of 2024 the standard project length for small (\n90\nhour) projects is\n8 weeks\n, while medium (\n175\nhour) and large (\n350\nhour) projects are\n12 weeks\nby default\nHistory\nThe event draws its name from the 1967\nSummer of Love\n(of the 1960s\nCounterculture\n), and the idea for the SoC came directly from Google's founders,\nSergey Brin\nand\nLarry Page\n.\n[\n1\n]\nFrom 2007 until 2009 Leslie Hawthorn, who has been involved in the project since 2006, was the program manager.\n[\n2\n]\nIn 2010, Carol Smith took over management of the program.\n[\n3\n]\nDuring the the period of 2005-2012 IIT Kharagpur had produced the highest number (51) of GSoCers from India\n[\n4\n]\n, and by 2016 there have been 92 GSoCers from IIT Kharagpur\n[\n5\n]\n.  But as of now,\nIIIT Hyderabad\nholds the record for producing maximum number of GSoC students from India.\n[\n6\n]\nApplication\nTo apply in Google Summer of Code, students need to write an application proposal to their respective mentoring organisations. Often mentoring organisations have their own application templates which typically asks the student to give biographical information, details of the project and a timeline. The application window typically opens up in March for a period of eleven days but it is recommended that students start working on their applications as soon as the list of participating organisations is announced.\nEligibility\nTo participate in GSoC one needs to be a student and should be more than 18 years old before the results are announced. There is no other requirement of department or year of study.\n[\n7\n]\nAlso, you cannot participate in Google Summer of Code for more than\ntwo\ntimes. This criteria is in application since 2017 edition.\nPost 2021, even non-university students can participate in GsoC.\nStipend\nUntil 2016, Google paid a total amount of US $5,500 in three batches. The initial amount of US $500 was paid at the end of the community bonding period, the second instalment of US $2,250 at the end of the mid-term evaluation, and the remaining amount at the end of the final-term evaluation. However, from 2017, Stipends are adjusted based on country ($2,400 for India) and are paid in three parts, one after each successful evaluation.\n[\n8\n]\n. This was later changed to 3000# for India in 2019 edition.\nFirst Evaluation (paid Late June / early July): 30%\nSecond Evaluation (paid Late July / early August): 30%\nFinal Evaluation (paid September): 40%\nGoogle offers payment through Payoneer in two modes, but for Indian students only direct deposit option is available. No money is given should one fail the evaluations, miss the deadlines or withdraw from the program.\nAs of 2024, Indian students get a stipend of $750 (for small sized projects), $1500 (for medium sized projects) or $3000 (for large sized projects) in two stages:\nMid Evaluation: (Mid July) - 45%\nEnd Evaluation (Early September) - 55%\nHighlights\nResources\nFLOSS Manuals\nhas a detailed manual about Google Summer of Code which includes sample student proposals.\nPython Software Foundation's FAQs on GSoC\nare also pretty informative.\nList of students\nThis list is\nincomplete\n; you can help by\nexpanding it\n.\nYear\nName (Batch)\nOrganization\nProject\n2009\nRaviteja Dodda\nOMII-UK\nGenerating Customized User Interfaces to the Cloud focusing on the requirement of the end-user\n2010\nAnurag Priyam (ME '13 )\nNESCent\nDevelop an API for NeXML I/O, and, RDF triples for BioRuby\n2010\nChidambaram Annamalai\nR Project for Statistical Computing\nrdx -

This should be done at-least\n15 Days\nin advance.\nProceed to\nStep 1\nif Vikramshila {V1, V2, V3, V4}, F127, F131, F132, F232-236, F244, S301, S302 have to be booked.\nProceed to\nStep 4\nif Kalidas, TOAT, Vikramshila Foyer, Gargi and/or Maitreyi have to be booked.\nStep 1:\nCDC Conflicts\n- Make sure the room you want to book is not pre-booked by CDC for internship and placement talks. Visit CDC and request them to release one room on the given date.\nLetter\n- Draft a letter addressing the\nAssistant Registrar (Academic section)\nrequesting to book the required venue, stating the time duration, date and purpose.\nSignature\n-  The letter would need the signatures of the present Governor of the society as well as that of the President of the Gymkhana in case of a Gymkhana society or just any professor would also do.\nStep 2:\nVerification\n-  Take the letter from Step 1 and go to Mr. Joydip at the UG Academic Section of the main building. Check with him if the venue is available on the dates contemplated. Ask him to write a note on your letter to confirm verification. You also have to get it signed and stamped by CDC if you had CDC conflicts in Step 1.\nIf the dates are not available, go to Step 0.\nIf verification is successful, proceed to Step 3.\nStep 3:\nOffice Order\n- Take the verified letter to the Secretary, at the Deans' Office on the 1st Floor of the main building, of the Dean of UGS and he will process the request. Collect the office order the next day from Mr. Hazra. You have to submit a copy to CDC if there were CDC conflicts in Step 1.\n// Keep this very carefully, as it is the only proof of a confirmed booking.\nEnd. You have successfully booked the desired venue. All you have to do now is show up at the event with the Office Order.\nStep 4:\nLetter\n- Draft a letter addressing the\nThe Registrar\nrequesting to book the required venue, stating the time, date and purpose.\nSignature\n-  The letter would need the signatures of the present\nGovernor\nof the society as well as that of the\nPresident\nof the\nGymkhana\nin case of a Gymkhana society or just any\nProfessor\nwould also do.\nStep 5:\nVerification\n-  Take the letter from Step 4 and go to the\nEstablishment Section\n, 2nd Floor, of the main building. A Lady is there who would check if the venue is available on the dates contemplated.\nIf the dates are not available, go to\nStep 0\n.\nIf verification is successful, proceed to\nStep 6\n.\nStep 6:\nOffice Order\n- Give the letter at the Establishment Section itself. There is no need to go to the Dean or any other person. Give it to the Lady there. Collect the\noffice order\nthe next day from the Establishment Section.\n// Keep this very carefully, as it is the only proof of a confirmed booking.\nEnd. You have successfully booked the desired venue. All you have to do now is show up at the event with the Office Order.\nStep 7:\nAudio Visual Cell\nGet a\nRequisition Form\nfor AV Cell.\nMr. Subrata Mukherjee\n(Subrata Da) [Phone: +91 9126123728] for Nalanda.\nMr. S.K. Sharma\n[Phone: +91 9933750851] for Vikramshila.\nIn case of any non arrangement/problems contact :\nProf. A. Roychowdhury\n, Chairman AV Cell [Phone: +91 9434306694]\nFill it up as per the requirements, like Microphones and Projectors, and submit it.\nFees:\nYou may need to pay a small\nfee\nto AV Cell for Mics and it's batteries post event.\nIf it's a Non-Working time (\npost 5 PM on weekdays or anytime on weekends\n, you need to pay the attendants of the AV Department). The fee as of 2018 is Rs. 90 per person per hour. (They generally always keep two people, so you can consider the minimum to be Rs 180 per hour). This rate is applicable for Nalanda and Vikramshila.\n//Remind him a few hours earlier on the day of the event about the requirements.\nStep 8: STOP\n[WARNING : All the steps are subject to availability of the respective people and this may result in you going multiple times to complete any given step.]\nExtra Funda\nSubhrata Da can get the AV equipment without the form too provided he trusts the person.\nNalanda Booking procedure is not tested so not mentioned.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_book_a_class_room&oldid=71491\n\""

The event is hosted in cycle by one of the participating institutions and is organized during the month of December. Inter IIT sports meet 2025 co-hosted by IIT Madras, IIT Hyderabad, and IIT Tirupati, will be held during the period 14-21 December. Aquatics is, however,separately organized as\naquatics meet\nduring the month of October.\nIt is one of the highly sought after events for sport enthusiasts, thus, witnessing an intense competition from teams to prove their mettle. It is also a place to forge new friendships and enjoy the fruits of your year-round efforts.\nObjective\nAs the Inter-IIT Rule Book notes, the main objective of Inter IIT Sports Meet is “to organize sports competitions in some selected Olympics-recognized events, to encourage sportsmanship, to promote and create a better harmony, understanding and friendly interaction among the students of the IITs as well as to foster a close association among them”\nIt also goes on add, “to make students aware of the importance of sports and games in a modern era, to help students perform skillfully in all life situations and also raise the standard of sports in IIT’s”.\n[\n1\n]\nParticipants\nAll the 23 IITs participants in the Inter IIT Sports Meet:\nIndian Institute of Technology Bhilai\nIndian Institute of Technology Bhubaneshwar\nIndian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi\nIndian Institute of Technology Bombay\nIndian Institute of Technology Delhi\nIndian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad\nIndian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar\nIndian Institute of Technology Goa\nIndian Institute of Technology Guwahati\nIndian Institute of Technology Hyderabad\nIndian Institute of Technology Indore\nIndian Institute of Technology Jammu\nIndian Institute of Technology Jodhpur\nIndian Institute of Technology Kanpur\nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur\nIndian Institute of Technology Madras\nIndian Institute of Technology Mandi\nIndian Institute of Technology Palakkad\nIndian Institute of Technology Patna\nIndian Institute of Technology Roorkee\nIndian Institute of Technology Ropar\nIndian Institute of Technology Tirupati\nEvents\nThe sports which are part of the General Championship are :\nAthletics\nBadminton\nBasketball\nCricket\nFootball\nHockey\nLawn Tennis\nSquash\nSwimming\nTable Tennis\nVolleyball\nWater Polo\nWeightlifting\nPerformance\nIIT Kharagpur has been crowned champions 13 times since its inception (in the Men's GC), and has been showing a sub-par performance for the past few years (coming third in last 2 years, and the last gold came way back in 2005).\nHistory\nThe proposition for an Inter IIT Sports Meet was brought up in 1961, and IIT Bombay hosted the first ever Inter IIT Sports Meet.

One of our illustrious alumnus and a successful entrepreneur Mr. Arjun Malhotra, had a vision of Telecommunication needs and its growth potential in India. Mr. Malhotra and his wife, Mrs. Kiran Malhotra, made an invaluable endowment for setting up the School of Telecommunications, to function as a center of excellence in the field of communication technology. It was conceived to fulfill the needs of education, research, technology development and training. The school has been assigned a role to collaborate with industry, academia, professional bodies etc. and function through various innovative means. Following are the specific objectives of the School: To take up research activities through M.S., Ph.D. and post-doctoral research programmes in order to keep pace with the advances in the area of telecommunications.To take up sponsored and consultancy projects from industries and government agencies.To offer general and specific tailor made training programmes on current topics.To set up laboratories and test facilities.\n[\n1\n]\nProf.\nSaswat Chakrabarti\nis the current Head of the School .\nResearch Areas\n5G Communications\nChemical and Material Science\nCloud RAN\nGreen Communications\nLarge MIMO Systems\nMechanical and Structural\nMillimeter Wave Communications\nMultiuser Information Theory\nPhysical Layer Secrecy\nSignal Processing for Communication\nUnion of networking & information theory\nResearch Laboratories\nHardware Laboratory\nMspc Lab\nNetwork Lab\nProject Lab\nReferences\n↑\nhttp://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/GS\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=G_S_Sanyal_School_of_Telecommunications&oldid=17977\n\""

Mid-semester has only a short online quiz and End-semester has around 90 minutes written examination. For project, first we need to select a topic and then we are assigned different professors according to our topics. We then continue our project work under the guidance of that professor. In my opinion, the main and most important task for the project is to choose a right topic.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nIn 2019, during Mid-Semester we had only 15 minutes online quiz and that too we can give from hostel. During End-Semester, we had 1 hour 30 minutes written exam in Nalanda. It was of 50 marks and contains 30 MCQ's of 1 mark each and 2 long answer questions of 10 marks each. For long questions, we need to attempt any 2 questions out of 6 questions. Try to remember the scientist's name who gave different theories and the authors of the famous books for MCQ's in End Semester. Long answer questions were just general questions related to the topics covered in the class.\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nNR421\nTuesday\nNR421\nNR421\nWednesday\nThursday\nLanguage Lab\nFriday\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=HS62002:_Science_Of_Happiness_And_Well-being&oldid=100142\n\""
