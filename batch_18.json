        "content": "The University of Alberta Research Experience (UARE) is a research internship program allowing top senior undergraduate students from key partner universities to conduct research at UAlberta under the supervision of faculty members who are experts in their field. UARE placements are available during winter (January to mid-March) and summer (May to August) for a period of 10-12 weeks.\nUniversity of Alberta International provides full support for participants before, during and after their placement. A formal orientation, professional development seminars, academic networking opportunities, and a poster symposium are all offered to program participants.\nEligibility\nSenior undergraduate students (3rd or 4th year)\nEnrolled in an undergraduate degree program at a designated partner institution (Partner Institutions in India: IIT Bombay, IIT Kharagpur)\nHave a minimum Grade Point Average of 3.0 or B on a 4-point scale (or equivalent etc).\nPast UARE participants are ineligible\nThere are many projects in a number of disciplines like Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Biotechnology, Environmental Engineering etc.\nApplication Procedure\nThe projects for summer are typically posted on their website by mid-September. The deadline to apply for UARE Summer 2016 was October 31, 2015.\nYou must upload the following documents with your online application:\nLetter of intent\nScanned Official Transcript\nResume/CV\nTwo academic references, submitted directly from the referee via the system\nAcceptance Notification\nThe notification of acceptance generally comes as an email between mid December and February.  The official offer letter, along with the immigration package is emailed to the students by mid march.\nPost Acceptance\nStipend\nCurrently the scholars receive a total amount of CAD 5,000 (CAD 2,000 commitment from the UAlberta faculty member or department; CAD 3,000 is funded centrally). A lump sum of CAD 3,000 is given to the students immediately upon arrival. The rest of the stipend, CAD 2,000 is dispatched late June, after the students are granted tax exemption. All the expenses including air tickets, housing and food for the 8 weeks stay in the US are to be borne by scholars from the above mentioned amount.\nLocation\nUniversity of Alberta is located in Edmonton, capital of Alberta, Canada. UAlberta's main campus is located in the centre of Edmonton, just minutes from downtown and surrounded by the beautiful river valley. With a major transit station on campus, there is easy access to the city’s many attractions. During the internship, opportunities to participate in cultural and social events such as city festivals or day trips to nearby attractions are offered on a weekly basis. A trip to the Rocky Mountains is made available to every intern.\nHousing\nInterns are responsible for their own housing. A few students stay in the Lister Centre, but most interns stay in subleased apartments, which are cheaper and available on campus or right outside campus. Since housing is cheaper outside campus, a number of students opt to stay far from the campus and take a convenient 10-15 minute ride to the campus in the LRT. Subleases can be easily found by visiting facebook pages listing sublease ads. Facebook groups formed by the scholars also turn out to be extremely useful sources of information.\nVisa\nThe application process for Canadian work permit visa is smooth. The application process is clearly listed on the Canadian immigration and travel website. Ideally, the VISA is delivered to you within 2 weeks of applying. However, the processing time of a work permit visa is known to vary between 20 days and 2 months. Hence, it is in your best interest to apply as soon as you receive the award letter and all the supporting documents.\nSee also\nList of internship programs\nHow to get a visa to Canada\nExternal Links\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=University_of_Alberta_Research_Experience_Programme&oldid=10682\n\""

Some topics are new whereas topics such as Internal Energy, Entropy and Laws of thermodynamics are taught from a new perspective which helps to understand the topic that come after end sem.\nAfter End Sem:\nVarious kinds of engines used in Aerospace Industry are taught which is called Parametric Analysis. Topics covered before mid sem will be helpful here. Ramjet,Turbofan, Turbojet and Propeller based engines are the ones whose parametric study is done.On surface its just bunch of equations but beneath those equations its mostly conceptual design of ideal engines.\nStudent Opinion\nThis course is the first of the two courses on Propulsion Systems in Aerospace Engineering. Second being Theory of Jet Propulsion which comes in 6th Semester. So if you want minimise your efforts in the 6th semester it's better to preserve your notes and understanding of the Aircraft engine.I will not say the course is very interesting to make it sound interesting but this course and its follow up course are quite relevant in industry.

        "content": "One of the newest additions to the Inter IIT Sports Meet,\nsquash\nwas Introduced as a preliminary sport in 2008 and was officially included in the point tally as the 13th sport in 2010.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe sport started with an initial participation of 7 IIT's which has now reached a total of 9 IIT's with the latest inclusions of\nIIT Jodhpur\nand\nIIT-BHU\n.\nBackground\nSquash is a racquet sport played by two (singles) or four players (doubles) in a four-walled court with a small, hollow rubber ball. The players must alternate in striking the ball with their racquet and hit the ball onto the playable surfaces of the four walls of the court. The game was formerly called squash racquets, a reference to the \"squashable\" soft ball used in the game (compared with the harder ball used in its sister game racquets).\nIn Inter-IIT however, it is a purely singles team tournament where each team comprises of 4 players and of that 3 players play singles games of best of 5 sets. The first team to win 2 singles games wins the match. 9 teams in the Inter-IIT are divided into 2 groups of 5 and 4, and the top 2 from each group qualify for the semi-finals.\n[\nunverified\n]\nInfrastructure\nCurrently, IIT-KGP has one court built inside the Technology Student's Gymkhana near the gymnasium. This court was built in the year 2011, just before the Inter-IIT was scheduled to be held in IIT-Kharagpur.

The classes are pretty fast paced and the notes provided are quite thorough. Questions in the paper require you to have clear understanding and thorough recollection of all things taught in class ( some questions would be straightforward coming from class notes and some questions would be similar to the tutorial questions given as HW)\nClassroom resources\nThe professor's classroom notes are pretty thorough. Additionally, the Professor provides a list of books which can be referred for additional understanding.\nAdditional Resources\nDoing the project required us to use the GNSSlogger app and GNSS analysis app, both provided online for free by google.

The Hall firmly believes in its motto:\nSanskrita Striya Parashakti.\nHistory\nSN/IG hall of residence is one of the oldest hall in the Institute.\nFor decades, the Hall has been the home away from home for both undergraduate and postgraduate women students. Despite the fewer number of its residents, the SN/IG Hall has carved its own niche in both academics and in various socio-cultural and sports events and competitions organized by the students’ Gymkhana. The Hall is also actively involved in all major students’ events such as the Spring Fest, Kshitij etc. In addition to representing IIT Kharagpur in various teams in Inter-IIT competitions, its residents have also consistently held offices at Technology Students’ Gymkhana.\nInfrastructure\nThe hall is divided into A, B, C, E, F, G, H, N, NR, W, S blocks. in four different buildings.\nOther facilities\nSports facilities\nThe has its own basket ball court, well equipped gym, table tennis facilites.\nMusic room\nThe hall has a well furnished music room for singing and dance practices.\nHall Library\nThe hall has its own library managed by the student body that issues books to the hall borders for a complete semester.\nFood and eateries\nThere is night canteen, Store, fruit stall and Nescafe in the hall.\nCommon rooms\nThere are two common rooms in the hall- Old and the new one. The new common room is well furnished air conditioned and has TV connection, projector screen.\nStudy room\nThere is one study room with the AC and capacity of 24 students attached with library.\nSpacious lawns\nGym Room\nWe have a fully functioning air conditioned GYM open 24/7\nAlumni\nThe bond that grows by living together in the same Hall has knitted many generations of SN/IG residents together. Its alumni are spread over the globe holding prestigious positions in academics, in corporate organizations, and other fields. To name just a few, Dr Parvati Dev (B.S.1968) Director, Stanford University School of Medicine, and President, IIT Foundation, late Dr Nina Saxena (B Tech 1992), Dr Chaitali Sengupta (B.Tech 1992), systems architect in Texas Instruments and one among the 100 Top Young Innovators of 2004 (MIT Technology Review), Dr. Sanghamitra Bandopadhyay, Indian Statistical Institute, Dr Serene Bannerjee (B.Tech 1999) of INTEL, Lachmi Khemlani (B Arch,.1990), author, instructor at UC Berkeley, researcher, and consultant in CAD. etc.\nThe Hall allows its residents a taste of both freedom and responsibility as the affairs of the hall are managed by the students themselves. SN/IG Hall shall continue to churn out well-educated, empowered and aware citizens, dedicated to strive for excellence in their fields, thus reflecting the changing face of the new generation of Indian women.\nHall Council 2023-2024\nHall President\n-\nSakshi Agarwal\nSecond Senate Member\n-\nRhea Vigil\nGsec Technology\n-  Akula Tejaswini\nGsec Social Cultural\n- Deepanajana Chakravarty\nGsec Maintenance\n-\nAnindita Malviya\n& Astha Kumari\nGsec Alumni Affairs\n-\nAnanya Singh\nGsec Mess -\nPornima Gaikwad\nGsec Library\n- Lakhavath Niharika\nGsec Students Welfare\n- Gayathri Amulya\nGsec Sports & Games\n- Pravalika Das\nEvents\nIllumination -\nThe biggest Gymkhana event... It is the event that everyone participates in (willingly or otherwise) for a whole month. All for a matka of sweets! The ILU part really takes a lot more time (cleaning diyas, wiring them, drawing chatais, etc...) a shortage of man-power on the actual event date greatly restricts plans. However, SN has been doing very well in Rangoli off-late. A picture of the '96 rangoli (3rd position) is given above.\nHall-day  -\nThe one time of the year when you can bring guests to your room (without having to be critically ill!). The hall is decorated with lights and all, everybody buys a lot of food, and the E-TMS very obligingly puts up a performance. Authorities are usually worried about 'uninvited-guests'... so residents have to set up an extensive 'security' system to check for invitations.\nFresher's welcome-\nJust as the name suggests, it marks the end of the OP. Restrictions have now made it very hard to have an OP of any sort but the fresher's welcome still is the greatest source of entertainment.\nSophomore Party -\nJust as the name suggests, it marks the welcome of sophomores in the hall. Nowadays freshers are allocated IGH and onboarding of second years happens in snig not freshers anymore so we have this party and its there first party in the hall and it is the greatest source of entertainment and it marks the beginning of hall bonding\nFinal year Farewell -\nThe final year farewell is markedly sober... ending in massive senti sessions with the final years handing out perps awards. It involves an extensively planned programme, a catwalk, a 'Miss SN' competition and some 'best senior in such and such awards'. This is accompanied by special dinner (where the mess ammas actually put up a good show) and ends in a lot of tempo shouts and dancing.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Sarojini_Naidu_/_Indira_Gandhi_Hall_of_Residence&oldid=238369\n\""

        "content": "(This guide was originally written by\nAbhigyan Sharma\n(CS '08), who got a perfect score in his year. Vaishnav Tadiparthi (AE '17) modified the article to suit current syllabus.)\nThis article serves as a complete guide to the GRE. A complete guide may not be a practical guide to follow. Everyone has his own way of studying for the GRE, this articles serves as a guide to pave your own, more realizable study path.\nThis article has been mainly written for the 2008 version of the GRE. One notable change since the 2008 GRE is the maximum score which is currently 340. This article is currently undergoing modification to adapt to the new GRE style.\nPart 1 : Mugging the words\nResources:\nWord Power Made Easy. It is not essential but it’s good to read it if you have a lot of time to go before GRE. The red book you will find lying around here and there. Helps build a solid vocab base, plus teaches the basics of etymology, i.e. the origin of a word and how to guess the meaning of a word. This book will take around 2-3 months to complete.\nWord Web Pro (for windows users). Just Ctrl+ Right-Click on any word on the screen and it shows the meaning, along with synonyms which helps remember other related words as well.\nAnswers.com. The first entry in this is from American Heritage Dictionary, which is a good dictionary, and it gives the etymology of the words which is of great help. The other entries, for example, Wikipedia or Thesaurus entries help understand the word.\nBarron’s word list. To feel comfortable I think it is necessary. Mugging it is a heck of a task, I agree. But some things can help in doing it. For example,\nAfter first iteration of Barron’s make a list of all unremembered words and try to memorize this list first\nFlashcardExchange.com. This site has a online flashcards of all barrons words plus a few more necessary ones. Here is the link. The list is in random order and you need to sort the list in the Options to read it sequentially. I could study faster online than from Barron’s. Also you could mark the incorrect words from it. This can help in making the list of unremembered words after first iteration.\nForming links: trying to forms links either through etymology or through synonyms or antonyms, this helps cluster the words as well as memorize them. You may also read up the Wikipedia entry from Word Web Pro, if it exists, to help understand the word.\nAfter memorising do study the list randomly. This will test and confirm your knowledge of the words.\nTry to know the exact meanings of the words, because this will help in analogies, where you need to make eliminate similar options.\nApps: Magoosh GRE app is available on both Android and iOS. Around 1000 words have been categorised on the basis of difficulty. Very useful in the last month of preparation. The Quizlet app has wordlists made by the public. Another popular wordlist that can be found in quizlet is the Manhattan's wordlist.\nSoftware\nThe google dictionary chrome plugin is an extremely convenient feature to quickly lookup meanings of words. Install the plugin and double click on any word on the internet, and a pop up will appear showing its meaning. This is helpful while reading difficult articles.\nArticles (Need Expansion)\nMugging up words is not enough, one must also know how to use them. Reading articles are an excellent way to learn word usage. Some of the best reading resources  include popular newspapers such as The NY Times, The LA Times, The Atlantic, The New Yorker and article compilation websites such as  Arts and Letters Daily (\nhttps://www.aldaily.com/\n). AL daily combined with the chrome plugin serves as an excellent source of new words.\nPart 2 : Practicing for verbal\nResources:\n1. Cracking the GRE (The Princeton Review): This book is very good. It has excellent strategies for verbal questions, which must be looked into. Plus you get to do with each purchase of book, two online Computer Adaptive Tests (CAT) like the actual GRE. The practice questions in the book are at par with GRE test.\n2. Power Prep: The authentic GRE stuff from ETS. Absolute must. It has practice questions and two CATs which can give the feel of actual GRE. Give it a shot around two weeks before the GRE to estimate your preparation.\n3. Barron’s: There are practice questions in the start and 5 model tests in the end. The question at the start can be practised. The model tests are OK, though little less tough than actual GRE. They can be practised by keeping a lesser time frame.\n4. Other Softwares on LAN: Several softwares are available on LAN/Internet. You can try and install them and see if they work. If they do, then well you can practice from them as well.\n5. Manhattan Prep: It is more than enough practice to solve all the questions in the 5 lb. book.\n6. Verbal Workout for the GRE (The Princeton Review): Extremely useful because it's very effective at telling you where you're most likely to go wrong.\nImportant things for Verbal:\nPower Prep must be done as it is exactly the same software in GRE test. It will get you acquainted with it. Also,The book Cracking the GRE has strategies for verbal questions which are very useful.\nVerbal Practice can be started after say half of the words have been mugged or after first iteration is complete. Then, both practice and mugging can be done side by side.\nReading Comprehensions (RC) take most of the time and you can get 3 to 4 of them. If one had infinite time, then all RC questions could be tackled, but to do so in 30 minutes, apart from other questions and without making silly mistakes, it needs practice.\nComputer based tests take more time than paper based tests. This is mostly due to RCs where you need to do a lot of scrolling. So while practicing on paper keep a time frame of say 27 minutes for the Verbal Section.\nThis is a strategy in case you are running out of time. Generally the last RC comes around 15th or 16th question. So, if you have 5 questions including an RC and say you have say 3 minutes left and the RC has 2 questions based on it, you can mark arbitrary answers for RC and move forward to answers the remaining 3 questions, which are likely to be non-RC and can be answered in 3 minutes easily.\nPart 3: Analytical Writing\nJust a few things which are important. Rest can be read from Cracking the GRE, which is an excellent resource for this.\nYou must know what score your writing can get you. The sample Essays included in Power Prep and on ETS site's GRE practice booklet can give a fair idea of what level your writing is and what level of writing is needed to get a 5/6 or a 6/6.\nThese are not normal essays. The stress is on reasoning and proving your argument. Some practice must be done to get used to the kind of writing that is needed.\nYou should know what score you want to achieve. It is written in Barron’s that for streams like engineering and mathematics, analytical writing is not as important as the Verbal and Quantitative. So if you can get a score of 4.5 or 5 out of 6 it is good enough. Also depending on your flair in writing, you can decide how much time to spend time on it. If you think you have to improve to get a decent score, then start at least 4 weeks before exam.If you are good and can get a 5/6 easily (after seeing the sample essays) , then you can start to practice late.\nOpening and concluding paragraphs are very important. They must be well written, and not rushed off. Apart from them, do write at least 3 paragraphs, having solid points, well-reasoned and with examples if possible.\nTime it well. Both the issue task and argument task is 30 minutes each (no break, so 1 hr for 2 essays). More speed is needed as the time is 30 minutes for each individual essay and it must be practised more. While practising always time and do both the essays back-to-back to build up the stamina needed for the exam.\nIf you know about the logical fallacies, it can help in finding the fallacies in Argument Task. Try and read through some of them online or through a book on logic if possible.\nPart 4: Quantitative\nJust hope you do not make any mistakes with it.\nThere is no need to hurry since there are 35 minutes for answering 20 questions which are not at all difficult. But every question is a potential silly mistake question. Take your time.\nBarron’s has good strategies for this section, which are worth following and make the job easier.\nThough it is possible to go without any preparation and score 170 but after doing some practice you get to know the pattern of questions and know the potential pitfalls which increase your chances of getting full score.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_prepare_for_GRE&oldid=102946\n\""

        "title": "Department of Agricultural and Food Engineering",
        "content": "About the Department\nThe Agricultural and Food Engineering Department\nwas established in 1952, as the Agricultural Engineering Department on the recommendation of the Dhar Committee appointed by the Board of Governors, IIT Kharagpur in 1950. Subsequently on the upgradation of its academic programme, the department was renamed as the Agricultural and Food Engineering Department in 1994. Among the sixteen IITs, IIT Kharagpur has the sole distinction of having an Agricultural and Food Engineering Department.It conducts annual fest named Prakriti to create a platform for sharing ideas about agricultural developments from all over the country.\n[\n1\n]\nAchievements\n[\n2\n]\nTractor drawn combination tillage implements\nTractor drawn combination tillage implements are developed which can prepare the seed bed with less time, fuel and number of passes as compared to conventional tractor drawn tillage implements.\nEducational and design software\nThe department has developed a few window - based interactive software packages for use as teaching and research tools. These include Decision Support System for estimating Reference Crop Evapotranspiration (DSS_ET), Hydrologic Calculator to perform various hydrologic analyses and Soil Conservation Structure Designer to design various soil conservation structures. DSS_ET includes more than 20 ET estimation methods. It estimates ET and ranks applicable ET estimation methods based on data availability and climatic condition.\nImproved device for wet soil preparation\nThe traditional method of rice cultivation in wet soil requires 5-6 times ploughing by bullocks. The time and energy spent by man and animal has been found to be greatly reduced by the use of IIT Puddler. The machine can be pulled by a pair of bullocks and can cover 1 hectare area in a day.\nMechanized production of Indian milk sweets\nProducts like �Chhana', is the base material used for preparation of several Indian sweets like rasogolla and sandesh. A technology has been developed for continuous production of chhana by using helical tube heat exchangers and a whey separator. Sandesh, a delicious milk-sweet can be produced continuously by using a screw kneader and a vented single screw extruder. Untouched by human hand, the product attains greater shelf-life than those available in markets.\nTea cultivation in non-traditional area\nTea is conventionally cultivated in sloping lands and foothills. The department has developed technology to successfully cultivate tea in plain lands and wastelands by adopting appropriate land slope, drainage, plantation of shade trees and pressurized irrigation. With these management practices tea can be grown in lateritic plains and wastelands.\nImproved tractor seat\nA tractor seat having 18.9 N.mm-1 spring constant and 1.09 N.s.mm-1 damping coefficient has been found to reduce significantly the vibration and bring comfort to the operator. The seat has been field tested and recommended for Indian tractors.\nLow-cost polyhouse technology\nPolyhouse has been constructed for cultivation of off-season crops at controlled temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide inside the structure as per the requirement of the crops. The house can also be used to raise seedlings of vegetables and flowers. It is made of locally available bamboo and GI poles, mild steel flats and ultra-violet stabilized plastic films.\nAir-recirculatory tray dryer for fruits and vegetables\nIn an air-recirculatory dryer, a part of the exhaust air is recycled along with the ambient air. This gives higher thermal efficiency and produces dry products having low surface hardness and improved colour and flavor characteristics. The developed dryer can produce 2-3 kg dry products in about 6-7 hours. The technology has been transferred to SSP Ltd., Faridabad.\nRecycling of waste into compost\nWaste materials generated from agricultural, forest, aquatic, domestic and industrial sources are recycled and converted into compost. Different microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria and earthworms have been used as compost accelerators. The technology has already been transferred to Shewood Agrotech to commercially produce solid Vermicompost and liquid Vermiwash.\nBiodiesel production from non-edible oils\nA suitable process along with a processor has been developed to produce biodiesel from nonedible oils such as Jatropha, Karanja, Mahua, Simaruba with high free fatty acids. The processor comprised a reactor, chemical mixing tank and a settling funnel and it can handle 10 liters of oil per batch. The yield of biodiesel is around 98% and the fuel properties of biodiesel so produced are within the biodiesel standards prescribed by India, America and Europe.\nMicrobial enzymes in food\nVarious technologies are developed and transferred to use microbial enzymes for clarification of apple juice, debittering of pomegranate juice and polishing of germinated brown rice.\nResearch & Development Facilities\n[\n3\n]\nFarm Machinery & Power\nThe discipline has developed modern Tillage & Traction lab, Tractor testing lab, Ergonomics lab and Biofuel lab.

Current understanding of the\nbiophysics of computation is completely different from the field of artificial\nneural networks. The course covers the very basics of the biology involved in\nneuronal processing up to understanding how neurons encode sensory\ninformation and how such information is decoded in the brain. Further the\ncourse covers phenomena of learning and plasticity of neuronal circuits. Overall\nthe course will equip students to provide different ways of solving problems\nrelated to learning using biologically plausible solutions and also allow\ninterested candidates to take up research in neuroscience, a highly\ninterdisciplinary field and contribute in areas of brain machine interface, neural\nprosthetics, biological sensors and many others.\nText Book\nTheoretical Neuroscience - Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Neural\nSystems by Peter Dayan and L.F.

The course starts with understanding brain at neuronal level and moves to understanding firing patterns. Professor does an amazing job in explaining things from scratch, assuming no prerequisites. Even basics of MATLAB can be picked up after taking the course. Students without much mathematical background can also complete the course by putting enough time and effort. Take this course if you are interested to learn about workings of human brain. But expect most of the stuff will be mathematical and computational, rather than biological.\nRegarding load, since the projects are exhaustive, they consume a lot of time.\nTime Table\nThis course has empty slot in ERP - Classes are to be conducted after 6 PM on weekdays and classes can also be on weekends. Generally, two 1.5-hour duration classes are held during the weekdays to cover the core content of the course and one 1-hour class during the weekends to cover required mathematical background.\nWEDNESDAY - 6:30pm to 8:00pm\nTHURSDAY - 7:00pm to 8:30pm\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=EC60007:_Computational_Neuroscience&oldid=235633\n\""
