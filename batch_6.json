        "content": "AIESEC\nHistory\nThe idea behind AIESEC started in 1938, when representatives from schools across Europe exchanged information about various programs and schools that specialized in business and economics. Students were carrying out internships in other countries. Mostly on their own initiative but it came to a standstill with the onslaught of World War II.\nIn 1944, the neutral Scandinavian countries were still exchanging students. In Stockholm, Bertil Hedberg, an official at the Stockholm School of Economics, and students Jaroslav Zich (of Czechoslovakia), Jean Choplin (of France) and Stanislas Callens (of Belgium) founded\nAIESEC\n. This was the predecessor of AIESEC, which was officially founded in 1948. At the time, the organization's stated mission was “to expand the understanding of a nation by expanding the understanding of the individuals, changing the world one person at a time.”\nAt the time of AIESEC's founding at the conclusion of the 1940s, Europe was in the midst of recovery from the war that dealt grave losses to its population. Factories and enterprises were in desperate need of executives, managers and leaders. The continent needed more than just business development, however; the war had severely damaged relations between European nations, and many members of the community felt steps needed to be taken to address this problem.\nAIESEC was formed to address both of these concerns. Students from seven nations: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden came together in March 1949 for the first International Congress of AIESEC in Stockholm. The founders composed a constitution for the new organization and defined a purpose: \"AIESEC is an independent, non-political, and international organization which has as its purpose to establish and promote the friendly relations between the members.\"\nIn the first year of AIESEC's existence, 89 students were exchanged among the member nations.\nFunctioning\nAIESEC\nis an international non-governmental not-for-profit organization that provides young people with leadership development and cross-cultural global internship and volunteer exchange experiences across the globe, with a focus to empower young people so they can make a positive impact on society. The AIESEC network includes over 100,000 members in 133 countries and territories. It is the largest youth-run organization in the world.\nSelections\nAIESEC\nIIT Kharagpur conducts 2 selections in the entire academic year, once during the autumn semester and once during the spring semester.\nActivities in Campus\nAIESEC provides a platform for students in IIT Kharagpur, by going on an international internship. These young individuals can develop their leadership potential by working and leading teams. Associate membership opportunities allow the students to work with various NGO partners of AIESEC, and represent their college as a part of campus ambassador program.The organisations products are Team Member Programme (TMP), Team Leader Programme(TLP), Incoming exchange (ICX) and Outgoing Exchange (OGX).\nReferences\nhttp://www.aiesec.in/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIESEC\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=AIESEC&oldid=239449\n\""

It is an organization of the students, for the students, by the students. It functions as two teams:\nThe Central Team\nThe Hall Coordinators Team\nHistory\nThe Counselling Centre was set up in 2009 by the Dean Of Students′ Affairs, IIT Kharagpur as an outcome of his efforts to make the campus a better campus for the entire student community.\nIt provided the students a place where they could easily approach with a problem and leave with a solution. The reach of the Counselling Centre was further extended through the Hall Coordinators Team. However, the increasing strength of students in the campus called for active participation from the students themselves in this cause. This was the scenario which saw the establishment of the Student Welfare Group in August 2011.\nStudent Welfare Group was initially an idea that evolved out of a feeling to perpetuate and nurture a campus life which is hassle-free. Today, it is a dedicated group of students willing to sort out various issues of concern for the students. It plans to emerge as a more successful organization with more activities managed and implemented for the welfare of students.\nVision\nThe aim of SWG is to ensure that every student's life in KGP is hassle free so that they can achieve their potential zenith while their stay in KGP as well as in their professional career. SWG aims to instil a belief in every student that they can achieve all their goals in life. SWG assists students in resolving their difficulties in every field, be it academic or extra-academic & curricular or co-curricular. It aims to create and sustain an environment that promotes personal growth and discovery, the pursuit of healthy minds and bodies, and participation in the creation of a caring community.\nEvents and programmes\nStudent Mentorship Programme\nThis programme involves the guidance and mentorship of every single first year student by a 3rd or 4th year student of the same department. The objective of this programme is to help the first years understand the various aspects of college life, and adapt accordingly. This programme ensures that the hindsight of the Mentor becomes the foresight of the Mentee. The Mentees can benefit immensely from the insight of the Mentor and find the best possible way to utilize their time in the campus. The Student Mentor Programme provides scope for constructive and productive interaction between the freshmen and the experienced seniors, which forms an integral part of college life.\nPDS Doubt Sessions\nAn interactive session organized by the SWG for those who feel like they are lagging behind in the course because of no prior knowledge.\nProgramming and Data Structures\nis an important course of the first year curricula. The instructors are senior students of the institute who try to increase the problem tackling capability of the students, starting from the very basic level and build up their confidence to face the competition. In Friday’s sessions, tutorial sheets are provided to the students and the tutors help them to solve the questions by clearing the doubts of each and every student. In Sunday’s sessions, students are supposed to come with their laptops and they are given a set of programming questions like the ones given in PDS Laboratory classes. The tutors help the students in coding, compiling and running their programs. At the end of the sessions, the instructors also provide printed solution of the tutorial sheet to the students.\nGD/PI Sessions\nStudent Welfare Group in association with Smart Training Institute, a renowned organization for grooming and perfecting\nsoft skills\n, presents an opportunity to boost students' performance at group discussions and personal interviews just as the season for internships and placements begins. The workshop has been a success in the past with most of the students giving positive feedback. Since the collaboration with the private institute is in its early phase, there is a lot of room and scope in future. Taking into consideration the feedback, the SWG aims to provide better workshops in the following sessions.\nPanel Discussion (Wings Of Fire)\nStudent Welfare Group organised a Panel Discussion by the batch of 2010-11. It invited students to open up to the valuable experience shared by the panelists in a discussion encompassing every facet of KGP life, including academics, extracurriculars, sports, societies and PORs. This discussion was very helpful for freshers who had just joined the institute. Panelists shared their vast experience of 4-5 years in KGP. Apart from freshers, a large number of 2nd and 3rd year students also gathered for this panel discussion.\nForeSight\nSWG\npresents\nForeSight\n, a program which provides the campus students a unique interface to connect with the people who have mastered their field and hence get a foresight of their future. It will cover various career related dimensions (placements, internships, FTs, competitions) from the students of the campus as well as alumni of the institute.\nThe Campus Tour\nA campus ride is being organized to acquaint freshers about the important places of the campus that a student needs to know. It begins from Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur (TSG). In 2015, more than 1200 freshers in 28 separate buses were shown the magnificence of the KGP campus with engaging interactions of SWG team with freshers.\nInformation Brochure- A Walk Through\nFor the first time in the history of our campus, printed version of Institute Information Brochure was circulated among all the freshers, thanks to the rigorous efforts of the SWG team and support of the administration. We hope it has helped the freshers batch a lot in their initial days here at KGP.\nISSUE\n[\n1\n]\nElectrical/Mechanics Doubt Sessions\nStudent Welfare Group is proud to announce Electrical and Mechanics Doubt Sessions for the first year UG students with the help of the Vice President, TSG and the faculty of Electrical Technology and Mechanics. The schedule of the doubt sessions is as follows:\nEvery Saturday\nstarting from 29th August, 2015.\nHall Coordinators Programme\nStudent Welfare Group conducts the Hall Coordinators Programme with the help of Hall Coordinators' Team that would work directly with the Counselling Centre for the overall well-being of the fellow peers and thus ensure 'A Hassle-free Kgp Life' !\nKGP Blood Connect\nKharagpur Blood Connect, an initiative of Student Welfare Group (SWG) IIT Kharagpur and Gopali Youth Welfare Society, established to serve the same purpose, is always there to help you in making your contribution, as \"To the young and healthy it’s no loss. To sick it’s hope of life. Donate Blood to give back life.\" It is an endeavour of ensuring that no one on campus struggles to find a blood donor in times of need!\nPublic Speaking Forum\nSWG has come with Public Speaking Forum , a platform which'll make you aptly equipped to fight the fear of Public Speaking. This is an 8 session long program. The initiative mainly concentrates on the individuals with a basic knowledge of English language however speaking on a public platform bothers them which can prove to be a hindrance in realizing their future endeavors.\nGovernors and Heads\n2024 - 25\nAdvisors\nAnish Behuray\nJainish Solanki\nKhushi Agrawal\nPriyanshi Khetan\nShubham Singh\nYash Kumar\nJSR Sujit\nNikhitha Sapharu\nExecutive Heads\nShashank Tiwari\nAstha Kumari\nHeads\nAkshat Kapoor\nShravan Barad\nBhawesh Kukreja\nVumika Ghosh\nShivam Bisen\nAstitva Srivastava\n2023 - 24\nAdvisors\nRithick Prabakar\nDhruv Rathi\nBishal Kumar Behera\nAditi Ujjain\nLalam Hari Prasad\nMd Zaid Alam\nPratik Choudhury\nSneha Majumder\nKeval Mehta\nHimadri Pandya\nAbhishek\nExecutive Heads\nJSR Sujit\nNikhitha Sapharu\nHeads\nAnish Behuray\nJainish Solanki\nKhushi Agrawal\nPriyanshi Khetan\nShubham Singh\nYash Kumar\n2022-23\nAdvisors\nDevesh Gobind\nTanaya Ramane\nSwagat Kumar Panda\nSreeya Chillapuri\nWaqaar Hussain\nAwais Akhtar\nSri Harika Reddy\nYathartha Soneji\nVedant Vani\nJeripothula Sindhu\nBhosale Shivam Pravin\nExecutive Heads\nHimadri Pandya\nAbhishek\nHeads\nRithick Prabakar\nDhruv Rathi\nBishal Kumar Behera\nAditi Ujjain\nLalam Hari Prasad\nKeval Mehta\nMd Zaid Alam\nPratik Choudhury\nSneha Majumder\n2021-22\nAdvisors\nKunal Das\nLavish Singhal\nTapasya Pratap Singh\nDevang Upadhyaya\nAditi Singhania\nNikhil Kumar\nAnimesh Jha\nPrachi Kharparde\nAkash Dusane\nExecutive Heads\nJeripothula Sindhu\nBhosale Shivam Pravin\nHeads\nDevesh Gobind\nTanaya Ramane\nSwagat Kumar Panda\nSreeya Chillapuri\nWaqaar Hussain\nAwais Akhtar\nSri Harika Reddy\nYathartha Soneji\nVedant Vani\nGovernors and Heads\n2019-20\nGovernors\nAkshat Jain\nAnju Joon\nLakshya Agrawal\nNishchal Baghele\nAdvisors\nRajat Goel\nHeads\nAnshul Agarwal\nKunal Das\nLavish Singhal\nMrityunjay Mehta\nRitam Talukder\nShivam Bhatia\nTapasya Pratap Singh\n2018-19\nGovernors\nUtkarsh Kumar\nPushpendra Singh Rathore\nPriyang Mani Tripathi\nAamol Lohani\nAdvisors\nDileep Shukla\nTYSS Santosh\nSaurabh Chandra Pandey\nHeads\nRajat Goel\nPrateek Manikpuri\nAkshat Jain\nAnju Joon\nLakshya Agrawal\nNishchal Baghele\nRajdeep Singh\nYograj Sirohi\n2017-18\nGovernors\nNihal Gupta\nVaibhav Agrawal\nRaju Bhakar\nAdvisors\nShashwat Mishra\nPrasanna Dange\nHeads\nUtkarsh Kumar\nPushpendra Singh Rathore\nAamol Lohani\nDileep Shukla\nPriyang Mani Tripathi\nTYSS Santosh\nSaurabh Chandra Pandey\n2016-17\nGovernors\nAmey Muley\nAkash Khandelwal\nKaran Gupta\nAdvisors\nTushar Gupta\nAshutosh Yadav\nManoj Meena\nSiddhant Jain\nSanket Modi\nHeads\nRaju Bhakar\nPrasanna Dange\nAnkur Ankit\nSurendra Puri\nShashwat Mishra\nNihal Gupta\nVaibhav Agrawal\nZain Ahmad\nVeda Vyshnavi\nPranitha Sriramoju\n2015-16\nGovernors\nAkash Verma\nAmit Anand\nNikhil Kedia\nSourav Basu\nAdvisors\nSheenal Chhabra\nAbhishek Chakraborty\nNishant Agarwal\nShankar Basava\nUma Ravali\nAnkit Bansal\nShyam Simaria\nHeads\nManoj Meena\nPrithvi Krishna\nKunwarvir Singh\nAkash Khandelwal\nChahak Tharani\nRavina Moirangthem\nAshutosh Yadav\nTushar Gupta\nKaran Gupta\nIshan Jain\nSiddhant Jain\nSanket Modi\nAmey Muley\n2014-15\nGovernors\nAbhishek Chaudhary\nNishchay Dayal\nHeads\nAkash Verma\nAmit Anand\nNikhil Kedia\nSourav Basu\nSheenal Chhabra\nAbhishek Chakraborty\nNishant Agarwal\nShankar Basava\nUma Ravali\nAnkit Bansal\nShyam Simaria\nReferences\n↑\nhttp://issuu.com/studentwelfaregroup/docs/ug_information_brochure\nExternal Links\nhttps://student-welfare-group.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SWGIITKGP\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swg.swg_app&hl=en_IN&gl=US&pli=1\nhttps://medium.com/@swgiitkgp\nhttps://www.instagram.com/swg.iit_kgp/\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Student_Welfare_Group&oldid=238341\n\""

He'd say that he won't mind attendance, but if you maintain a 100% attendance you'll be given extra marks at the end, so no matter what try not to miss classes.\nNote: Marking is quite strict, you need to write everything you know about what's asked with sketches, but don't write long paragraphs, write in small points, that will help in scoring better.\nClassroom resources\nmay personally ping me sometime later, can't access it right now*\nAdditional Resources\nSir would recommend you some books at the beginning of the course, you may want to try those.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=AR22004:_Water_Supply_And_Sanitation&oldid=96692\n\""

It is one of the dramatic society which is under Technology students' Gymkhana and is a part of the Dramatics Subcommittee under the Social and Cultural Committee. This is one of the oldest societies in IIT Kharagpur.\nActivities\n1)\nIndependence day production\nOn 15th August, every year, Druheen perform a play which can also be called fresher's introduction production. The cast includes mainly second year and fourth year. Seniors mostly the fifth year attends the practice session for supervising and teaching the drama. This production mainly happens to encourage freshers who come new to the campus.\n2)\nFresher's workshop\nThe freshers are given a thorough training of theatre oriented workshops that teache them the basics of dramatics. Skills like voice modulation, voice intensity, dramatization, body posture, stage movements, third forms, etc are taught in groups. First years along with the four governors train for three weeks at the Main Building. Occasional skits, monologues, and challenging impromptu are attempted to improve the versatility of the actor.\n3)\nFresher's production\nThe play takes place mainly after the midsem. This play officially performed by the fresher's. Mainly the third year students train the juniors. The plays mostly include entertaining characters to encourage the freshers.\n4)\nAnnual production\nThis is officially the last production of the academic session. The cast includes members of the first year to final year. Generally, the students who pass out perform in this play. The play takes place at the end of March.\nFunctioning\nSelection procedure\nDruheen selection auditions are held once per year, only for first years from both UG and PG. The society selects a batch of 25-30 first years (UG) and 2-5 PG at the beginning of the academic year soon after the Independence day production. The selection procedure consists of tasks that judge voice modulation, intensity, speech and diction, confidence and acting skills.\nOrganizational Structure\nDruheen has four governors selected by the society seniors every year who takes care of the society and represent it in the Gymkhana.

        "content": "We surely feel proud when we enter IIT Kharagpur campus and look at the main building where it is written: Dedicated to the service of the nation. Indeed, there has been tremendous progress in the development of science and technology and IIT Kharagpur has remained devoted in this regard from its very inception. The world has reached to a point where people plan for ‘space travel’ or ‘Mars mission’. Today, medical science has developed so much that it can cure almost all diseases. The revolution in the field of information technology during the last couple of decades is easily noticeable. IIT Kharagpur is now recognized globally for serving all these fields.\nHowever, this has been only one face of development. While we live with all the comforts in the 2,100 acres campus of IIT Kharagpur, millions of people of India are struggling everyday to make their both ends meet. The recent NSSO data shows that 670 million Indians in rural areas live on Rs 33 per day. Unequal distribution of wealth has become more and more prominent with the fact that 10% of the population holds three quarters of India's wealth and 1% holds half of it. While the employment growth slowed to 0.3%, the slowest in four years, employment growth in the manufacturing companies plunged to (-)5.2% in 2014-15 from 3.2% in 2013-14. The news of farmer suicide is haunting us almost everyday. The society has remained trapped inside poverty, unemployment, corruption, caste oppression, violence against women, communal disturbances and so many. Surely, there has been a huge gap in the development of science and technology and its service to the society.\nWith all these odds and with the concern for the society, the Science Education Group (SEG) was formed by the students of IIT Kharagpur in early 1980's. SEG involved itself in searching different dimensions connecting science and society. It actively took part in theoretical discussions and social practices to do justice to its quest for social and scientific knowledge. The group functioned till early 1990's. However, their rich experiences and the present time have inspired a group of students and professors to carry forward the banner of SEG. We believe that this campus acts as a sanctuary with all sorts of privileges and keeps us disconnected from the issues that affect the vast masses of people in India. Since, we proudly state that we are “dedicated to the service of the nation”, SEG thinks that it is our responsibility towards our nation to question and analyze the status quo to better serve the society. As written by Bhagat Singh “Any man who stands for progress has to criticize, disbelieve and challenge every item of the old faith”, SEG would like to act as a platform to study various scientific and social issues by holding sessions for discussions and debates. Objectives of SEG can be listed as follows:\nHold sessions for discussions and debates on various scientific and social issues.\nStudy, discuss and debate the thoughts of Bhagat Singh, Ambedkar and other progressive thinkers.\nConduct various social welfare programs inside the campus or in nearby villages.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Science_Education_Group&oldid=13966\n\""

After the ‘F’ grade(s) has/have been substituted by better grades during a subsequent semester, the SGPA and the CGPA of all the semesters, starting from the earliest semester in which the ‘F’ grade has been updated, will be recomputed and recorded to take this change of grade into account.\nHow to Calculate CGPA Result?\nCGPA result is the sum of results of more than one semester or year. GPA results of multiple semesters or years are divided together to show a single result and that is the CGPA result. The CGPA result is calculated by multiplying the credit score of each subject by multiplying all the grade scores by the total credit score.

It participates with consistent success in\nParliamentary Debates\nacross the world, and had organized the IIT Kharagpur Model United Nations Conference and the IIT Kharagpur Parliamentary Debate in previous years. In 2020, a team from KGP DebSoc went on to become\nthe first all-Indian team to reach the ESL (English-as-Second-Language) finals of Australs\n, one of the most prestigious debating tournaments in the world.\nIn 2024, a team from KGP DebSoc emerged as the\nwinners of ESL (English-as-a-Second-Language) finals of Uhuru Worlds\n, one of the biggest and most prestigious international tournaments.\nCampus events and tournaments\nSelection process\nThe Debating Society is always looking for smart, enthusiastic debaters, and takes in new members all year round. There is no restriction on the year of study, and members have joined as late as 4th year. However, to provide more structured training, and to spread awareness, it holds Fresher Selections and Senior Selections at the beginning of the year. This is followed by a training workshop, which lasts about a month, where newcomers to parliamentary debating are taught various facets and nuances of structured argumentation.\nRegular activities\nThe Debating Society tries to meet at least two times a week for practice sessions. These are usually conducted in the foyer of the Main Building, with multiple debates often happening around the place. University-level competitive debates have two preeminent formats - the 3v3 Asians Parliamentary Debate, and the\nBritish Parliamentary Debate\n, which has four teams of two in a single debate.\nIn addition to foyer debates, it participates in national and international debating competitions all year round. Members choose their own teams or decide to adjudicate. Participating at many high-quality tournaments is regarded as the way to excel, and members are supported by the society for things like getting permissions from professors, and reimbursement of expenses.\nOther events conducted include the Intra-KGP Debate Tournament and the\nFoundation Day\ndebates.\nHistory\nDebating Society member Sanat Mehrotra conducting the freshers' workshop on 18 August 2013.\nKGP Debate Club\nAlthough students have been arguing at IIT Kharagpur for over half a century, the activity was only institutionalized in 2009 as a part of the 'KGP Debate Club'. It was founded by Sumeet Mohanty (BT '11) and started as a loose affiliate of the\nTechnology Literary Society\n(TLS). The KGP Debate Club began its activities on campus as an active interest group and marked IIT Kharagpur's entry into competitive parliamentary debating. Membership was not exclusive - meetings and debates were open to all and were held in the institute foyer. There were only a handful of members in the Autumn of 2009 and almost all the early recruits were from TLS. The NLSPD 2009 in Bangalore was the first tournament at which the KGP Debate Club represented IIT Kharagpur. This was followed by participation at NUJSPD 2010 by a team of freshers. The Debate Club held its first open selections prior to this tournament, and all the participants for the tournament were selected here.\n[\n2\n]\nIncorporation as a Gymkhana society\nIn Autumn, 2010, the KGP Debate Club was formalized as a full-fledged Gymkhana society independent of the TLS. The first governors were Achyut Bihani (BT '12), Shikha Singh (MA '13) and Anand Kr (CS '12).\nEarly in the Autumn of 2011, the number of governors was increased to four, and the KGP Debate Club was rechristened as 'Debating Society, IIT Kharagpur'. Two of the Governors - Adarsh Mathew and Prashanth Durai - commissioned a logo for the society, and it was created by Avik Dey. In the same semester, the Debating Society and\nSpring Fest\nagreed to jointly conduct IIT Kharagpur's first-ever Model United Nations Conference. Thus, IIT Kharagpur Model United Nations Conference was founded with Prashanth Durai as the first\nSecretary-General\n.\n[\n2\n]\nList of governors\n2010: Achyut Bihani (BT '12); Anand Kr (CS '12);

        "content": "Kalpana Chawla Space Technology Cell, IIT Kharagpur\nSpace Technology Student Society\nFounded\n2008\n(\n2008\n)\nFounder(s)\nMayur Maheshwari\n[\nunverified\n]\nNumber of members\n45\nWebsite\nwww\n.facebook\n.com\n/spAts\n.iitkgp\n/\nUnder\nTSG\nNo\nSpace Technology Student Society (spAts)\nis a student initiative that functions as the student body of\nKalpana Chawla Space Technology Cell\n(KCSTC), the contact point of\nIndian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)\nat IIT Kharagpur. It organises the annual Space Technology and Astronomy themed fest,\nNational Students' Space Challenge\n[\n1\n]\n(NSSC) every year since 2011.\nspAts\nignites a passion for space exploration at IIT Kharagpur by organizing talks, discussions, stargazing sessions, lectures, and presentations.\nThe group publishes a bi- semester newsletter, '\nThe Moonwalk\n', which features on latest ventures in space technology and astronomy related articles and developments.\n[\n2\n]\nHistory\nThe Space Technology Students' Society was founded way back in 2008 by a group of students extremely enthusiastic about the frontiers of space technology. It was formed as an official student body under the Kalpana Chawla Space Technology Cell (KCSTC). Since then, the society has grown in size and activities. The idea of a national level space-oriented fest was conceived and thus implemented as the National Students' Space Challenge (NSSC) in the year 2011. NSSC has been successfully organised for twelve more editions since then.\nA subgroup of spAts, the FQTQ team which is a dedicated Astronomy discussion group was formed in 2016 under the guidance of Siddhant Singh.\nFunctioning\nThe student body of spAts is divided into two subgroups - the core teams consisting of Design team, Tech team and Management team (which is more concerned with management and outreach) and the FQTQ team (which is more based on Astronomical discussions and applications). spAts organises sky-gazing sessions, space-themed discussions and talks, webinars, lectures, presentations and publishes the bi-semester newsletter, \"the moonwalk\" for the people in the IIT Kharagpur community. The teams also organise the National Students' Space Challenge during the months of September-October.\nSelection Procedure\nspAts organises its selections during late August, once per year that is aimed only for the newly joining freshers for a continued membership till the end of the members' tenure. spAts organises an introductory seminar before the selections, where the functioning of the society as well as about NSSC is presented.\nThe interested candidates join as Junior Coordinators (JCoords) who conduct the NSSC. For the JCoord team, the candidate's technological, management, communication skills etc. are considered.\nLater, selections for joining the spAts team happen, where interested candidates select one portfolio from the FQTQ team, Design team, Tech team and Management team where emphasis is given on prior knowledge in the specific portfolio, presentation skills, previous experience with the concerned technologies and knowledge in the fields of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Selections are done in three rounds, an initial interview, a task round and a final interview where the task submissions are reviewed.\nOrganisational Structure\nspAts is mainly comprised of its two subgroups - the Core teams and the FQTQ team. Each subgroup have their own undertaking tasks but mainly the whole team collectively organises the NSSC fest.\nCore teams\nThese teams are mainly responsible for Management, Outreach, Communication, Publicity, Sponsor handling, Design, Web Design and Finance for the fest and the other activities spAts organises. The core teams consist of the Design team, the Tech team and the Management team\nFQTQ team\nFQTQ stands for From Quarks to Quasars, which describes the team more oriented to astrophysics in general. They hold periodic discussions and presentations on various topics along with sky-gazing events, open talks, webinars and content development.\nNSSC\nConducting the fest remains a major task for the whole spAts team. The team structure is as follows -\n5th and the 4th years comprise the Steering Committee (SCom)\n3rd Years are the Heads\n2nd Years function as Sub-Heads for the various events\nFirst Years contribute as Junior Coordinators (JCoords) for the fest\nList of Activities\nspAts organizes a lot of activities within the campus, as mentioned below.\nInduction Workshop\nThe spAts team interacts with the new coming Freshers batch during the Induction Programme through a series of presentations and workshops. In 2018, presentation on the life cycle of stars, the ever endless universe; and hand-on experience through water rocket lift-off workshop was conducted. The workshop received a positive response from the participants.\nNational Students' Space Challenge\nThe\nNational Students' Space Challenge\n, abbreviated as\nNSSC\n, is an annual space-themed fest organised in the month of September-October since the year 2011. It is India's first and the largest space technology and Astronomy themed fest. The whole spAts team is indulged in organizing the fest.\nFor more details find it on -\nNSSC\nSky-Gazing Sessions\nspAts also works to popularize astronomy among the people in the KGP community. Hence it organizes sky-gazing sessions every semester and also to cover exciting astronomical events, like the super blood red moon 30th January, 2017.\nSpace Month\nEvery Year spAts observes the month of March as Space Month, where a series of open discussions, webinars quiz or presentations are held. This space month primarily aimed to bring and contribute towards recent developments in space technology.\nThe Moonwalk\nThe Moonwalk is a bi-semester newsletter brought by the spAts team. It includes articles written on several astrophysical ideas, new perspectives arising in space and planetary sciences, recent developments in the field, contributions by eminent scientists over the world and discoveries.\nAwards and Achievements\nCompetition\nVenue\nAbout\nYear\nPosition\nAstro Quiz, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi\nTeam name - \"TheKGPCrux\"\n2019\nGOLD\nExploring the Interstellar, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi\nObservational astronomy based event\n2019\nSILVER\nScientists of Utopia, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi\nCase study event\n2019\nSILVER\nScientists of Utopia, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi (Online)\nCase study event\n2021\nGOLD\nAstro Quiz, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi (Online)\nSpace Quiz Event\n2021\nGOLD\nInternational Astronomy and Astrophysics Competition\nOnline\nEeshaan Sethia (Subhead) - International Runner Up\n2022\nNational Topper\nReferences\n↑\nNSSC\n↑\n\"Reaching for the stars\"\n.

        "title": "How to conduct your own event with no money",
        "content": "This is a wiki version of the article published in The Scholars' Avenue\nhere\n.\nThe title is actually a misnomer so the writer apologies for that straight off the bat. The writer did have to use his own money for some parts but it is in the process of reimbursement so it is technically correct. This is a rundown of the experiences he had while trying to conduct the event for Quiz Club, IIT Kharagpur with funds from the Gymkhana budget and the problems he faced.\nThe Approval\nDecide on the event, the dates, the people who are going to work and the other logistics. Don’t decide till the last final detail but just to the point where you know that you have someone in mind for every task.\nPing the GSec responsible and see if it will actually be entertained as an idea. This is the part where you can decide if you can conduct the event and let the GSec handle the reimbursement and approvals later on or do it yourself (HINT: Pick Do It Yourself). For certain events, if it has been cleared in the budget in the start of the year, you can skip the next three points.\nSend a mail to the President, TSG and request a meeting (for any department related activity, change this to HOD, for a hall related activity, first discuss everything with the Hall President and for a project related activity, approach the Project Head or the Dean in charge)\nOnce you convince the person in-charge, the President, TSG in my case, prepare a proper draft of the proposal with the expected expenditure for everything and discuss it with the other people who are going to be a part of the process. Also, finalise the dates in your mind for the event at this moment.\nApproach the President once again and keep the other people in power aware about your plans and get this proposal approved. Now, you enter the part where your speed is determined by the administrative machinery. The only way you can speed up the next steps is, in the words of the great Prof. Alastor ‘Mad-eye’ Moody, “CONSTANT VIGILANCE!”. My proposal with the identifying information redacted can be found as a template\nHERE\n.\nThe Funds\nThe President, after approval will redirect you to a staff in-charge, who in the case of TSG is called Sports Officer In-charge. (There is one such person for every single event, competition or society that comes under the ambit of the TSG and this is a person you want on your side. For department events, go to your department office and ask and help you shall receive.) Approach this person and ask him/her about the budget and show him the approved proposal. He will tell you if the event is feasible under the current remaining budget or not and if it is, will prepare a NOTE SHEET with a formal list of all the things you have received approval for.\nIf the event requires you to have a large part of the amount before the event starts, ask your Staff In-charge to apply for an advance. It requires permission from the DoSA or the Director, IIT Kharagpur based on the amounts that you need an advance for. Any other professor generally just has authority to approve expenditure, not actual disbursement of funds. The rules for Departments and Halls are different and your Department/Hall office will have clearer details for different types of activities. If advance was deemed not necessary (as in the writer's case), conduct the event, use your funds where you absolutely need to or get the vendors to accept payment later whenever possible and take bills for everything. It will be needed later.\nIf approval for advance was granted, your Staff In-charge will get the money in his account and he will give the amount to you to use during the event. You’ll still have to maintain all bills as in the point above and give all of them with clear details on each expense.\nThe Venue\nOnce this money part has been cleared, you’ll need a venue for the event. Looking back at point 4, you should already have the dates in mind. For the venue booking, you’ll need to go to the Academic Section, Main Building, 3rd Floor. You will need a letter signed by a Sports Officer In-Charge or a Professor, mentioning the Date and Time Slots you need the venue for. For certain rooms, you’ll need a clearance stamp on that letter from the CDC as well that they are okay with you taking the room for the said duration. Gymkhana has forms in the mentioned formats that you can take for TSG activities on which a Senior Sports Officer’s Sign or the President, TSG’s sign is required.\nThe Deputy Registrar in the Academic Section will redirect you to another staff for the room booking who’ll finally get you a letter signed and stamped by the Academic Section. You’ll need this to book AV Cell facilities if you need them.\nFor this next part, go to the CWISS Building, right in front of Mining Department and take the AV Cell form from the office and fill and submit it with a copy of the letter you received in the point above. Remember this place, you might have to come here again to get the final bills for AV Cell activities.\nCongratulations, you’ve succesfully completed all the activities needed to be completely ready for the event logistics.\nNow, go ahead with your publicity and get posters printed (GET GST BILLS for Reimbursement) and call your friends, family, wingies, profs, girlfriends, boyfriends, whoever you’re interested in calling and conduct the event.\nAfter The Event\nMaintain bills on everything that you spent money on, order them and keep proof of winners for competitive events signed by the judges. Prepare a sheet with all these things and add each bill as and when you get them.\nOnce the bills are ready, go and submit it to the staff and explain how it is ordered and you’re done.\nYour part is done. The Gymkhana will take a few millennia before it comes to your file and the accountant there considers it worthy of his time and like Schrodinger’s Cat, your money will either die while stuck in his file or will get cleared one day and you’ll get a happy surprise reminiscent of seeing something working that you’d considered long dead.\nThe writer was joking in the paragraph above( but not for everything :) ).\nTo ensure it doesn’t become a joke on you, go and sit in front of the accountant everyday till he begins to hate your face and decides to clear the file and process it. Go to sleep once you receive your money and dream about the nightmarish day when you had decided to step into this entire process.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_conduct_your_own_event_with_no_money&oldid=23729\n\""

Nevertheless, this course serves as an introduction to compressible flows. Some might find it to be difficult in the beginning as it requires a clear understanding of thermodynamics.It will require some reading to have a clear understanding.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nThe paper depends on the professor setting it, and considering it has been taught by different professors over time, it will not resemble previous year papers very much. The tutorials are quite helpful when it comes to the numerical problems. The conceptual ones would be from concepts taught in class or would be found in any book. The paper would not be difficult, might be lengthy in some cases though.\nClassroom resources\nBook : Modern Compressible Flow, JD Anderson.\nTutorials and class notes ( can be taken from a senior/classmate or from DC)\nAdditional Resources\nBooks : 1.
