        "content": "Foreword\nTechnology Students’ Gymkhana is the hub of the numerous extra-curricular and cocurricular activities ranging from sports to music. The Gymkhana is managed by the students,\nfor the students, under the guidance and active participation of the faculty and staff members. Any extensive system of operation needs to be guided by rules, regulations and a constitution. The constitution of the Gymkhana was drafted in 1952 and was revised in 1974. With rapid changes occurring on various fronts in the Institute, the students have felt the need for some revisions of the constitution to reflect the changed condition. Professor S.C.Roy, the present President of the Gymkhana requested Professor Y.P.Singh. an old alumnus and presently a Professor of the Institute to examine the document and to propose revisions. After discussion with the Deans and the concerned student office bearers, the final revised version of the condition is presented here. I must acknowledge my gratitude to Professor Y.P. Singh and others who have contributed to the revised Constitution. I hope this Constitution will serve to heighten the involvement and commitment of the students to the Gymkhana activities.\n( K. L. Chopra )\nDirector, IIT, Kharagpur\n& Rector\nTechnology Students’ Gymkhana\nPreamble\nThe Constitution of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana was drawn in the year 1952, and subsequently revised in 1974. The basic structure and philosophy of the Gymkhana as envisaged by the founding fathers of the Institute have stood the test of time, and have been instrumental in contributing to the all round development of the IITians during the last four decades.\nHowever, substantial structural changes during the last two decades have necessitated some modifications in the Constitution of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana. The proposed amendments have been evolved through detailed discussions with a broad cross section of the students and the academic community over a prolonged period, and aim to further enhance the role of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana in aiding its members in the cultivation of their interests in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. The major changes are in respect of the following:\nStructural adjustments in the composition of various Committees and Subcommittees for providing a greater degree of initiative to the Secretaries through a greater degree of decentralization. The Executive Committee has been redesignated as the Executive Council to reflect these changes.\nThe Students’ Senate has been given its due recognition as an advisory body to the Vice-President on various matters relating to the Halls of Residence, disciplinary issues and general welfare of the student body.\nThe Students’ Court would fulfill a long felt void and would promote the growth of a more responsible and more self confident student body.\nThe functions of the Modelling Sub-committee have been redefined. This sub-committee would organize the Hobby Club and shall, in collaboration with the Nehru Technology Museum, organize an Inter-hall Modelling Competition in order to provide a new dimension and to give a fillip to the creative potential of the members of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana.\nIt is fervently hoped that these suggested amendments would make the Technology Students’ Gymkhana instrumental in playing a more positive and vibrant role in adding many more dimensions to the multifaceted talents of the members.\nKharagpur                                                                     ( YASH PAL SINGH )\nMarch 17, 1993                                                 Professor of Electrical Engineering\nConstitution Of The Technology Students’ Gymkhana\nINDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nKharagpur – 721302\n1.

        "title": "How to apply to graduate school",
        "content": "(This guide was originally written by Niharika Gupta(CH '16) and some major edits were done by\nVivek Rai\n(BT '17))\nGraduate student applications for the US require GRE, TOEFL, recommendations, transcripts, and SOP.\nTimeline\nEvery department in universities have their own deadlines. Some universities can have deadlines as early as November; some can have in May. You would need to send your GRE and TOEFL scores according to the deadline specified on the university’s website.\nYou can expect to have ALL the admission decisions to be informed by March end, though most universities send out decisions mostly by Jan/Feb. And some universities have rolling admissions as well.\nCost\nFor each application, it costs between $90-$150 to apply.\nChoosing the universities\nFor Masters, I would say go with the high rankings. If you are not sure that you have good enough credentials, apply to a mix of high-ranked, mid-ranked and low-ranked. Though my suggestion would be to not go below Top 50.\nhttps://yocket.in/\nis a nice website to check out which universities you should try for with your GRE, TOEFL scores, your GPA and your achievements (published research papers etc). It will provide you details of the universities termed ambitious, moderate and safe for your profile. I found the app even more convenient for this. However, this provides a basic outlook of where you might go and does not confirm if your application will be accepted or rejected.\nGPA, GRE, TOEFL requirements\nThere’s no minimum GPA criteria that universities set usually. Some might mention some no. on a scale of 4. You would want to check in websites like WES to calculate your GPA scaled in 4 to make sure. You would also need it for some universities which would require your GPA on that scale.\nThere is no minimum requirement for GRE as far as I have seen. But I would recommend try not losing any marks in Math.\nUniversities generally have a minimum TOEFL score requirement ranging from 70 to 100. Make sure to check that on their websites.\nWriting SOP\nSee also:\nHow to write SOP\nLength\nIt is recommended to limit your statement of purpose to not more than 2 pages ensuring a legible font size (10pt or 11pt). Also, different schools may have their own limits on the length of SOP, for example, 500 words, 1 page. Also, most of them require you to answer a \"specific\" question but eventually it tends to be similar across all. In some places, one may asked to write an diversity essay, albeit of a much shorter length.\nProtip:\nWrite in as much detail as possible (2-3 pages of initial draft) and then cut down as required.\nContent\nThe role of statement of purpose varies depending on the target degree, that is, master's vs doctorate. For example, statement of purpose for doctorate programs generally tend to focus more on research content supported heavily with suitable research experiences. Mention your major achievements, internships, projects. Mention 1-2 instances in detail during your internship/project that shows the person you are, keeping aside the technical skills. Avoid plagiarism.\nProtip:\nIt is recommended to write an initial draft and then look at other people's statement of purpose to get a idea of structure. Remember to have it reviewed by as many people as possible.\nProcedure\nStandardized examinations\nSee also:\nHow to prepare for TOEFL\nand\nHow to prepare for GRE\nGive GRE and TOEFL as soon as possible. The earlier you get done with them, the better. In that way, you also have the time to give GRE again if you are not satisfied with your score. Generally, a GRE score above 320 and TOEFL score above 100 is considered acceptable. Since both exams require you to send your scores to institutions, it'd advised to have a list of potential institutions where one is going to apply.\nCreating applications\nDecide for a major in which you would want to pursue your Masters. It need not be the same as your bachelors. I would suggest go for your interest.\nRead the websites of the department you are applying to very carefully. It would have many required details like the deadlines of GRE, TOEFL, application. They might have some unique programs as well, for example Master’s degree in combined Engineering and Law, Professional Degree Program, etc.\nWhile you are deciding which universities to apply to and simultaneously researching their websites, you would want to start writing your SOP as well. Get it reviewed by friends, family, seniors. Some universities want very specific points in it, so you would have to tweak it accordingly.\nOnce sure which universities to apply to, visit their website to get the link to the online application form which would require you to make an account. Application forms are quite lengthy and some fields might be confusing. Email their graduate admission office if any doubts.\nSend GRE and TOEFL scores to the chosen universities, if not done already. Some of the application forms would let you know if the universities received your scores.\nAfter you submit the application, you would be guided to the page where you have to pay the application fees. Usually it would be required to pay with credit card.\nGetting recommendations\nSee also:\nHow to write a recommendation letter\nAsk for recommendations from Professors, industry professionals etc. At least 3 recommendations are required for each university and some of them may specify that 1 or 2 must have to be from a Professor who has taught you or been your supervisor. It is recommend to reach your recommender at least 2-3 weeks before the deadline.\nDocuments\nMostly, universities require the scanned copy of your transcript that you would be uploading in the application form. But some universities require your transcripts to be mailed by post or e-transcript. However, IIT Kharagpur does not issue an e-transcript and you'd need to have a physical copy of your transcript signed and sealed by the Dean of Student Affairs. For that, one has to visit Dean's office (first floor Main Building, where the Director's office is) with your i) original transcript, ii) few clean copies of your transcript on original (A-1) sized paper and an\nairmail\nenvelope for each, and iii) your student identity card. The envelope and the copy can be acquired from RLB photocopy center or Tech Market. The Dean's secretary would verify that they are your documents and make a register note (original transcript is returned). Sealed documents can then be collected from the officer later based on Dean's availability.\nOther Advise\nPhillip Guo -\nA Five-Minute Guide to Ph.D. Program Applications\nThe PhD Grind\n- This is memoir by Phillip Guo describing the his experience as a Computer Science PhD at Stanford. It is good peek into what a life as PhD might look like.\nSee also\nHow to get a visa to USA\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_apply_to_graduate_school&oldid=42308\n\""

        "title": "How to file ITR for income declaration",
        "content": "(This guide was originally written by Shivam Kumar Jha[CS '22])\nThis guide explains in step-by-step approach how you can file an Income Tax Return for your parents, and use the documents procured to submit as Income Declaration Proofs. As per\nthe official document\n, dated 14.07.2020, ITR documents are accepted as valid proofs. This is the easiest method of all in order to provide proof of income that can be completed online.\nThe process is completely online, is super easy to fill for anyone with basic financial terms knowledge (like income, deductions, etc.) and can be completed in half an hour for each filing.\nWho Can File ITR\nEveryone with an income, no matter whatsoever the amount, can file an ITR online very easily. Below are the necessary requisites:\nShould have PAN Card\nShould have their AADHAR Card Linked With the PAN Card\nPrimary bank account (in the name of the person you are filing for) should be linked with the PAN Card\nShould have their phone number linked with their AADHAR Card\nShould have detailed information about their income and income sources; having Form 16 makes the process much easier.\nNOTE: For people with zero income, a small amount of income like Rs. 5000 can be shown while filing the ITR in the gross income field. Your filed ITRs are verified against the bank account and AADHAR card linked with the PAN.\nHow To File\nA really easy way to file ITR is to use an online service like\nClearTax\n. Below are the steps you can follow:\nRegister yourself on Cleartax or login if you are already a member.

        "title": "Resources for Placements",
        "content": "December can be a harrowing time for final year students who enroll themselves for the placement process. This wiki is an effort to compile the best-practices and resources that helped students get job offers, in various sectors. Each section contains interview processes, FAQs, placement semester preparation guides and a list of essential resources.\nSectors\nThe companies that visit campus to recruit students can be broadly categorized under the following sectors - consulting, investment banking/ finance, software development, data analytics, FMCG, and core engineering.\nConsulting\nInterview Process\nThe interview process involves multiple levels of interviews. The initial rounds may be over telephone, Skype or in person subject to the company's preference. There maybe a total of 3-5 rounds of interviews. The interviews may be of the following types :\nCase Interviews : They are the most important/difficult interviews for a consulting job. The question may or may not involve numbers. Be sure to ask as many questions as you can, and be at your presentable best.\nGuesstimates/ Data Interpretation : The structure and methodology is far more important in these questions, than to get the numbers right.\nHR Interviews : This involves usual HR questions with a special preference to how presentable the candidate is, to potential clients and also on what the candidate is really interested in, as consulting companies face attrition problems all the time.\nFAQs\n\"Tell me something about yourself, walk me through your resume.\"\n\"What's the most challenging environment/work you've faced?\"\n\"Why consulting? Why the firm? Why you?\"\n\"Where do you see yourself 5/10 years later?\"\n\"What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses?\"\n\"Mention one of your failures.\"\n\"Questions on being a team player, leader, displaying ownership, creativity and initiatives\"\nPlacement Semester Survival Guide\nForm a case group, and practice as many cases as you can. Your interviews must ideally be your interview number 50 or above.\nConsulting companies love high points in your CV, be it in academics, extra-academics, sports, competitions, etc. So, highlight them, or further extend the list if possible.\nWork on your communication skills. This is generally used to reject candidates even if they are good problem solvers, as the companies require you to speak to clients on a regular basis\nResources\nMust do resources [Compulsory reads]\nCase in Point -  Marc P.

This test has short programming questions and at times knowledge questions on programming languages. Most common questions on programming languages are on C,C++ or Java.  After you qualify the coding test, you get shortlisted for the interview, usually for all the SDE positions. The general process consists of 2-3 technical rounds followed by 1 HR round. Some companies (Usually Microsoft) has a Group Discussion Round too to shortlist where they give a design question of a system where everyone is asked to collaborate and discuss on how to design the specified system as Company employees judge on how much a candidate contributes. In the technical rounds, they ask 2-3 coding questions which you have to code on paper(proper syntax and everything, not pseudo code) and/or domain related questions from DBMS, Networks, OS and ML(if mentioned in the resume). The biggest focus is on whether you can find an optimal algorithm to solve the given problem/ implementation, and then code it in a reasonable amount of time.\nFAQs\nThe coding questions are usually from DP or graph theory. Definitely brush up on your C++/Java skills - Base class / Super Class / OOP / Abstraction / Encapsulation\nPreparing for the typical HR questions is a must. Other than that you should have \"introduce yourself\" prepared and oriented to the company position that you are applying to.\nExplain one of the projects that you have worked on, in detail. Be sure to go through your resume very well and have something prepared for every project/ achievement that you have written on your resume.\nPlacement Semester Survival Guide\nCode. Code. Code. Take an active interest in competitive programming. Participate in competitions by codechef/hackerrank/topcodef/codeforces.Even if you can solve the problem during the contest, go back later and check out the editorial, and then solve it. If you still cant, see the author's / tester's solution and then solve it. By december, you should be able to solve all problems easier than \"Medium\".\nTry finishing of questions in all related domains on hackerrank - Algorithms/C++/Java/Python/Data Structures etc.\nStrengthen your fundamentals in the core CS subjects such as DBMS, ML(if you have mentioned it in your resume), Networks and OS.\nPractice competitive programming regularly on sites such as codeforces, codechef.\nTake up projects.

        "title": "Department of Agricultural and Food Engineering",
        "content": "About the Department\nThe Agricultural and Food Engineering Department\nwas established in 1952, as the Agricultural Engineering Department on the recommendation of the Dhar Committee appointed by the Board of Governors, IIT Kharagpur in 1950. Subsequently on the upgradation of its academic programme, the department was renamed as the Agricultural and Food Engineering Department in 1994. Among the sixteen IITs, IIT Kharagpur has the sole distinction of having an Agricultural and Food Engineering Department.It conducts annual fest named Prakriti to create a platform for sharing ideas about agricultural developments from all over the country.\n[\n1\n]\nAchievements\n[\n2\n]\nTractor drawn combination tillage implements\nTractor drawn combination tillage implements are developed which can prepare the seed bed with less time, fuel and number of passes as compared to conventional tractor drawn tillage implements.\nEducational and design software\nThe department has developed a few window - based interactive software packages for use as teaching and research tools. These include Decision Support System for estimating Reference Crop Evapotranspiration (DSS_ET), Hydrologic Calculator to perform various hydrologic analyses and Soil Conservation Structure Designer to design various soil conservation structures. DSS_ET includes more than 20 ET estimation methods. It estimates ET and ranks applicable ET estimation methods based on data availability and climatic condition.\nImproved device for wet soil preparation\nThe traditional method of rice cultivation in wet soil requires 5-6 times ploughing by bullocks. The time and energy spent by man and animal has been found to be greatly reduced by the use of IIT Puddler. The machine can be pulled by a pair of bullocks and can cover 1 hectare area in a day.\nMechanized production of Indian milk sweets\nProducts like �Chhana', is the base material used for preparation of several Indian sweets like rasogolla and sandesh. A technology has been developed for continuous production of chhana by using helical tube heat exchangers and a whey separator. Sandesh, a delicious milk-sweet can be produced continuously by using a screw kneader and a vented single screw extruder. Untouched by human hand, the product attains greater shelf-life than those available in markets.\nTea cultivation in non-traditional area\nTea is conventionally cultivated in sloping lands and foothills. The department has developed technology to successfully cultivate tea in plain lands and wastelands by adopting appropriate land slope, drainage, plantation of shade trees and pressurized irrigation. With these management practices tea can be grown in lateritic plains and wastelands.\nImproved tractor seat\nA tractor seat having 18.9 N.mm-1 spring constant and 1.09 N.s.mm-1 damping coefficient has been found to reduce significantly the vibration and bring comfort to the operator. The seat has been field tested and recommended for Indian tractors.\nLow-cost polyhouse technology\nPolyhouse has been constructed for cultivation of off-season crops at controlled temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide inside the structure as per the requirement of the crops. The house can also be used to raise seedlings of vegetables and flowers. It is made of locally available bamboo and GI poles, mild steel flats and ultra-violet stabilized plastic films.\nAir-recirculatory tray dryer for fruits and vegetables\nIn an air-recirculatory dryer, a part of the exhaust air is recycled along with the ambient air. This gives higher thermal efficiency and produces dry products having low surface hardness and improved colour and flavor characteristics. The developed dryer can produce 2-3 kg dry products in about 6-7 hours. The technology has been transferred to SSP Ltd., Faridabad.\nRecycling of waste into compost\nWaste materials generated from agricultural, forest, aquatic, domestic and industrial sources are recycled and converted into compost. Different microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria and earthworms have been used as compost accelerators. The technology has already been transferred to Shewood Agrotech to commercially produce solid Vermicompost and liquid Vermiwash.\nBiodiesel production from non-edible oils\nA suitable process along with a processor has been developed to produce biodiesel from nonedible oils such as Jatropha, Karanja, Mahua, Simaruba with high free fatty acids. The processor comprised a reactor, chemical mixing tank and a settling funnel and it can handle 10 liters of oil per batch. The yield of biodiesel is around 98% and the fuel properties of biodiesel so produced are within the biodiesel standards prescribed by India, America and Europe.\nMicrobial enzymes in food\nVarious technologies are developed and transferred to use microbial enzymes for clarification of apple juice, debittering of pomegranate juice and polishing of germinated brown rice.\nResearch & Development Facilities\n[\n3\n]\nFarm Machinery & Power\nThe discipline has developed modern Tillage & Traction lab, Tractor testing lab, Ergonomics lab and Biofuel lab.
