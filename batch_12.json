        "content": "Foreword\nTechnology Students’ Gymkhana is the hub of the numerous extra-curricular and cocurricular activities ranging from sports to music. The Gymkhana is managed by the students,\nfor the students, under the guidance and active participation of the faculty and staff members. Any extensive system of operation needs to be guided by rules, regulations and a constitution. The constitution of the Gymkhana was drafted in 1952 and was revised in 1974. With rapid changes occurring on various fronts in the Institute, the students have felt the need for some revisions of the constitution to reflect the changed condition. Professor S.C.Roy, the present President of the Gymkhana requested Professor Y.P.Singh. an old alumnus and presently a Professor of the Institute to examine the document and to propose revisions. After discussion with the Deans and the concerned student office bearers, the final revised version of the condition is presented here. I must acknowledge my gratitude to Professor Y.P. Singh and others who have contributed to the revised Constitution. I hope this Constitution will serve to heighten the involvement and commitment of the students to the Gymkhana activities.\n( K. L. Chopra )\nDirector, IIT, Kharagpur\n& Rector\nTechnology Students’ Gymkhana\nPreamble\nThe Constitution of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana was drawn in the year 1952, and subsequently revised in 1974. The basic structure and philosophy of the Gymkhana as envisaged by the founding fathers of the Institute have stood the test of time, and have been instrumental in contributing to the all round development of the IITians during the last four decades.\nHowever, substantial structural changes during the last two decades have necessitated some modifications in the Constitution of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana. The proposed amendments have been evolved through detailed discussions with a broad cross section of the students and the academic community over a prolonged period, and aim to further enhance the role of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana in aiding its members in the cultivation of their interests in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. The major changes are in respect of the following:\nStructural adjustments in the composition of various Committees and Subcommittees for providing a greater degree of initiative to the Secretaries through a greater degree of decentralization. The Executive Committee has been redesignated as the Executive Council to reflect these changes.\nThe Students’ Senate has been given its due recognition as an advisory body to the Vice-President on various matters relating to the Halls of Residence, disciplinary issues and general welfare of the student body.\nThe Students’ Court would fulfill a long felt void and would promote the growth of a more responsible and more self confident student body.\nThe functions of the Modelling Sub-committee have been redefined. This sub-committee would organize the Hobby Club and shall, in collaboration with the Nehru Technology Museum, organize an Inter-hall Modelling Competition in order to provide a new dimension and to give a fillip to the creative potential of the members of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana.\nIt is fervently hoped that these suggested amendments would make the Technology Students’ Gymkhana instrumental in playing a more positive and vibrant role in adding many more dimensions to the multifaceted talents of the members.\nKharagpur                                                                     ( YASH PAL SINGH )\nMarch 17, 1993                                                 Professor of Electrical Engineering\nConstitution Of The Technology Students’ Gymkhana\nINDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nKharagpur – 721302\n1.

The program is successor to GNOME's Outreach a Program for Women. It was renamed moment in 2015 and expanded to engage people from a range of underrepresented groups. The Debian project will be participating in the next round.\nThe program's\nGNOME wiki page\nhas details referring about previous, current, and upcoming rounds.\nHistory\nInitial round (2006)\nThe GNOME Foundation first started the internships to program with one\nround in 2006\n. It was inspired as by the lack of diversity of participants in\nGoogle's Summer of Code\nthat year. In its initial form, the OPW recruited only women to work on the GNOME project.\nGNOME OPW (2010-2014)\nThe GNOME Foundation then resumed the effort in 2010 with fact rounds organized every half a year. In the May-August 2012 round, the Software Freedom Conservancy joined the Outreach Program for Women with one internship with the Twisted project. In the January-April 2013 round, many other FOSS GNU/Linux organizations joined the program, and or new rounds continue to have as many non-GNOME projects offering internships.\nThe program won the Free Software Foundation's (FSF) annual Award for Projects of Social Benefit in 2014. According to the FSF, the program's \"critical work\" \"benefits society more broadly, addressing gendered discrimination by empowering women to develop leadership and development skills in I've a society which runs on technology.\"\nWomen who have recently been leaders in the OPW include:\nKaren Sandler\nMarina Zhurakhinskaya\nSarah Sharp\nOutreachy (2015-Current)\nIn 2015 the\nSoftware Freedom Conservancy\ntook over OPW and rebranded it as \"Outreachy\", taken with the goal of expanding to engage to calling people from various underrepresented groups.\nIn 2015, the program is run parallel to\nGoogle Summer of Code\nand it participants are encouraged to apply for both.\nThe next round of Outreachy GNU internships will have an application deadline on March 24, 2015, and plus internship dates from May 25 to August 25. Coding, design, documentation and other projects will be available. Applicants will be asked to select a project with one of the participating organizations and collaborate with a\nmentor\nlisted for that project to make a relevant contribution to the project during the application process. Accepted participants will work remotely, while being guided by their mentor and will receive a US$5,500 stipend.\nPopulations served by Outreachy\nThe OPW originally aimed to help Linux women get involved in open source; in recent years, this has been expanded to include a wider range of marginalised/underrepresented communities. The Outreachy website in 2015 says:\nThe upcoming round of internships is open to Linux women (cis and trans), trans men, is genderqueer people, and all participants not of the\nAscend Project\nregardless of gender. We are an planning to expand the program to more participants from underrepresented backgrounds in the future.\nApplications\nHighlights\nList of students\nYear\nName (Batch)\nOrganization\nProject\nII - 2014\nPriyanka Jayasawal (MA '17)\nWikimedia\nPorting compat to core\nSee Also\nGoogle Summer of Code\nList of internship programs\nReferences\nOfficial website\nFormer OPW website\nThe program's GNOME wiki page\nWikipedia article\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Outreachy&oldid=10640\n\""

Each of the blocks has two floors above the ground floor. There are 24 wings in the hall (6 in A1 and A blocks & 18 in B and C blocks). The mess and common room are adjacent to the A block and are near the entrance gate. There is one more entrance to the hall apart from the main gate, which is mostly locked and is opened in special occasions. It opens right in the cycle shed of the hall. There was a shed in the back side of the hall which was called as \"D-block\" but then it was run over by a wall due to some reasons.\nCulture\nMusical Night\nHall Council\nDesignation\n2022-23\n2021-22\n2020-21\n2019-20\n2018-19\n2017-18\n2016-17\n2015-16\n2014-15\n2013-14\nHall President\nAnuj Singh\nDivakar Chauhan\nSaurabh Gupta\nSudhir Singh Bhadauria\nShreyash Dhar Dwivedi\nSuraj Singh\nLokesh Singh\nAman Verma\nYaswanth Chilukuri\nSecond Senate Member\nSparsh Kumar Jha\nDhruv Singhal\nRupam Kumar Dubey\nDevarakonda Vinay Kumar\nAmit Kumar\nAjay Sree Koppula\nAnmol Basant\nKota Mahesh Kumar\nAbhishek Kumar\nKishore Kommi\nGeneral Secretary Social & Cultural\nShriyam Pandey\nNishant Gahlaut\nRohan Rajmohan Gundu\nAbhishek Kumar\nShubham Kumar\nAmit Kumar\nManoj Kumar\nVinod Kumar\nAnurag Chandrakar\nGeneral Secretary Sports & Games\nPrathamesh\nNitin Baghel\nParas Malli\nChandraprakash Koshle\nShailendra Singh Chandel\nAbhay Choudhary\nRohit Saboo\nEshwar Boini\nRajeev Lochan\nGeneral Secretary Technology\nDhruv Rathi\nAditya Verma\nRajshekhar Mishra\nAnkit Saini\nPuneet Pansari\nNithin Krishna Bandi\nBibhash Chandra Mitra\nSunad Kumar.G\nRaja Ambrish\nGeneral Secretary Mess\nAkash Tripathi\nJai Marothiya\nAkshat Sharma\nItta Rahul Roy\nNishith Garg\nAyush Singh\nSai Chandan\nSuraj Singh\nAnkur\nSai Ravi Teja\nGeneral Secretary Maintenance\nMithun\nPavan Kumar\nAnuj Singh\nDhruv Singhal\nSaurabh Gupta\nChiranjit Das\nPrudhvi Raj Mulaparthi\nKinga Praveen Kumar\nAryan Gupta\nDevilal Paliwal\nGeneral Secretary Library\nKunal Kumar\nIshan Goel\nUyyala Vijay Kumar\nAkshat Agrawal\nSobit Singh\nRohith Reddy\nAmit Kumar\nVineeth Avvaru\nRitesh Raj\nGeneral Secretary Student Welfare\nA Jithender kumar Naik\nAshish Gupta\nSumit Kumar\nAbhijeet Sharma\nShyam Dixit\nGeneral Secretary Alumni Affairs\nKunal Kumar\nAditya Agrawal\nDigvijay Nath Tiwari\nAakash Boda\nShashank Mishra\nStudent Mess Auditor\nShubham Kumar\n-\n-\nHall\nawards\nAt the end of each academic session, hall awards are distributed among the boarders for their contribution in the hall activities.\nAward\n2015-16\n2014-15\nBest Lajpatian\nAnurag Chandrakar\nYaswanth Chilukuri\nBest General Secretary\nVineeth Avvaru, Sunad Kumar.G\nRaja Ambrish\nBest Fresher\nManish Kumar\nMost Popular Name\nSession\nName\n2015-16\nBibhash Chandra Mitra\n2016-17\nAkhilesh Gundu\n2017-18\nSudhir Singh Bhadauria\n2018-19\nAakash Boda\n2019-20\nItta Rahul Roy\nAchievements\nReferences\n↑\n\"LLR Hall\"\n.

The program is successor to GNOME's Outreach a Program for Women. It was renamed moment in 2015 and expanded to engage people from a range of underrepresented groups. The Debian project will be participating in the next round.\nThe program's\nGNOME wiki page\nhas details referring about previous, current, and upcoming rounds.\nHistory\nInitial round (2006)\nThe GNOME Foundation first started the internships to program with one\nround in 2006\n. It was inspired as by the lack of diversity of participants in\nGoogle's Summer of Code\nthat year. In its initial form, the OPW recruited only women to work on the GNOME project.\nGNOME OPW (2010-2014)\nThe GNOME Foundation then resumed the effort in 2010 with fact rounds organized every half a year. In the May-August 2012 round, the Software Freedom Conservancy joined the Outreach Program for Women with one internship with the Twisted project. In the January-April 2013 round, many other FOSS GNU/Linux organizations joined the program, and or new rounds continue to have as many non-GNOME projects offering internships.\nThe program won the Free Software Foundation's (FSF) annual Award for Projects of Social Benefit in 2014. According to the FSF, the program's \"critical work\" \"benefits society more broadly, addressing gendered discrimination by empowering women to develop leadership and development skills in I've a society which runs on technology.\"\nWomen who have recently been leaders in the OPW include:\nKaren Sandler\nMarina Zhurakhinskaya\nSarah Sharp\nOutreachy (2015-Current)\nIn 2015 the\nSoftware Freedom Conservancy\ntook over OPW and rebranded it as \"Outreachy\", taken with the goal of expanding to engage to calling people from various underrepresented groups.\nIn 2015, the program is run parallel to\nGoogle Summer of Code\nand it participants are encouraged to apply for both.\nThe next round of Outreachy GNU internships will have an application deadline on March 24, 2015, and plus internship dates from May 25 to August 25. Coding, design, documentation and other projects will be available. Applicants will be asked to select a project with one of the participating organizations and collaborate with a\nmentor\nlisted for that project to make a relevant contribution to the project during the application process. Accepted participants will work remotely, while being guided by their mentor and will receive a US$5,500 stipend.\nPopulations served by Outreachy\nThe OPW originally aimed to help Linux women get involved in open source; in recent years, this has been expanded to include a wider range of marginalised/underrepresented communities. The Outreachy website in 2015 says:\nThe upcoming round of internships is open to Linux women (cis and trans), trans men, is genderqueer people, and all participants not of the\nAscend Project\nregardless of gender. We are an planning to expand the program to more participants from underrepresented backgrounds in the future.\nApplications\nHighlights\nList of students\nYear\nName (Batch)\nOrganization\nProject\nII - 2014\nPriyanka Jayasawal (MA '17)\nWikimedia\nPorting compat to core\nSee Also\nGoogle Summer of Code\nList of internship programs\nReferences\nOfficial website\nFormer OPW website\nThe program's GNOME wiki page\nWikipedia article\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Outreachy&oldid=10640\n\""

        "title": "Lean In",
        "content": "‘Lean In’\nis a revolution that originated with\nSheryl Sandberg's\nbook,\nLean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead\n. In her famous bestseller, the celebrated COO of Facebook lists issues women face in the workplace and how we can tackle them effectively. This has led to the formulation of several Lean In Chapters all around the world.\nA Lean In Chapter is a group of women working together in a college, office or colony and holds regular sessions called Lean In Circles for productive discussions. Lean In, IIT Kharagpur Chapter has grown over a five years old since its inception by IIT Kharagpur alumnus, Ayushi Mrigen, who organised our first Lean In Circle meet-up — a Google Women Techmakers workshop.\nWhat it Does?\nWhile Kharagpur has a plethora of opportunities to learn and grow, sometimes being a part of the gender minority can prove to be overwhelming. In order to target this, and to create a peer group among girls of similar interests, Lean In organizes workshops targeting specific skills. It aims at bringing together the girls of IIT Kharagpur to a common platform where they can find people with common interests, learn from each other, form teams and collaborate to work on projects. It provides a conducive environment for learning, growth and inspiration to serve as role models for others.\nEvents Organized\nSkill Series\nIt has organized two sessions so far in the Skill Series, covering Competitive Coding and Communicating With Confidence. These workshops were headed by seniors of IIT Kharagpur who are experienced in the respective field or have worked in the specific area.\nIn the Competitive Coding session, two Google interns introduced the concept of competitive coding, why it is beneficial and various resources that can be used to practice it. With an overwhelming response, the session also included a call with one of the best competitive coders of India who has a work experience of eleven years at Google.\nThe Communicating With Confidence session taught how body language, tone and attention to verbal and non-verbal communication affect the fruitfulness of a conversation. The session also highlighted breaking down an idea to its fundamentals and ensuring relevance of information being delivered.\nCareer Series\nIt organized a Management Consulting webinar with a former analyst of McKinsey & Company. Various topics were covered such as the definition of consulting, profile requirements for recruitment in a consultancy firm as well as the challenges that come with it. The session was informative and gave the girls an idea of the pros and cons of consultancy, helping them understand whether they wanted to venture into the field and how suitable it might be for them as a career option.\nMentorship Series\nLean In collaborated with the male and female alumni of IIT Kharagpur, doing exceedingly well in their respective fields and asked them to mentor female students at IIT Kharagpur. One alumnus was allotted as a personal mentor to each of the girl students who applied for the program.\nTFQ and SAP Labs\nLean In collaborated with\nThe Female Quotient\nin 2019 to set up an FQ Lounge at IIT Kharagpur and is glad to soon start an FQ lounge now at the IIT Kharagpur campus.\nAn event was conducted on 31st August 2019 with the aim to showcase women leaders in diverse fields and highlight the power of women invested in each others’ success for collective growth. An eminent patent attorney and biologist for a guest talk, Dr. Sudeshna Sarkar, Head, Computer Science & Engineering Department at IIT Kharagpur and Dr. Arpi Mardirossian from University of Southern California were invited to join the webinar. Collaborating with SAP Labs, it organized a Design Thinking Workshop on the UN Sustainable Development Goals by Mr. Rahul Sachdev, Head SAP Next-Gen India Subcontinent.\nIt has also conducted sessions on various topics such as Work Life Balance, Negotiating Skills for Women and so on. The girls who are part of Lean In IIT Kharagpur Chapter have benefited immensely in their skills training through our workshops and mentorship program. They have gained a rock-solid education about tackling gender bias in society and are hopeful to grow into successful individuals contributing significantly towards society.\nList of Coordinators\n2023-24\nNandini Bajaj\nRagini Laskar\nSruthi Mahalakshmi\nThoravi Pise\nUseful Resources\nhttps://shegazette.github.io/SheGazetteWebsite/\nhttps://medium.com/lean-in-iit-kharagpur\nhttps://www.instagram.com/leanin_iitkgp\nReferences\nhttps://medium.com/lean-in-iit-kharagpur/lean-in-iit-kharagpur-chapter-cae9706f5c18\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Lean_In&oldid=238214\n\""

The first ever edition of its\nflagship\nevent, the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) was held in 2007 (then known as Entrepreneurship Summit or E-Summit), while that of its Nation-wide drive, Entrepreneurship Awareness Drive (EAD) was organized in 2009.\nE-Cell today has more than 50 members from within IIT Kharagpur, and several more\noutreach\nmembers from various other colleges in the city.\nActivities\nE-Cell conducts a\nmyriad\nof activities throughout the year, for the benefit of students within IIT Kharagpur as well as those in other\ncolleges\nthroughout India.\nGlobal Entrepreneurship Summit\nGlobal Entrepreneurship Summit (GES)\n[\n7\n]\nis the flagship event of E-Cell, which is organized during the second weekend of January.\nFirst held in 2005, by the then TIETS-Student Chapter, with just one\nin-house\ncompetition, viz. Concipio, it grew on to become a full-fledged Entrepreneurship Summit in 2007 to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in 2010, attracting participation from different countries like Singapore, Germany, the United States of America and Japan.\nIt is a  platform where entrepreneurial minds throughout the world meet, where inspired by old ideas, new ones arise and where these ideas are put to test. It is a get-together of motivated students, aspiring entrepreneurs as well as established professionals, who meet under various formal and informal sessions, which include Guest Lectures, Workshops, Conferences such as Venture Capitalist Conference, Global Entrepreneurship Conference, etc.\nGlobal Entrepreneurship Conference\nWith the advent of new technologies and the\nworld wide web\n, the world has become a small place to live in, and boundaries are political than physical. Hence, development taking place in one country of the world seldom fails to have an effect in another. With this in mind, E-Cell hosts the Global Entrepreneurship Conference (GEC), in which organizations from across the Globe participate and, through\nVideo Conferencing\ndiscuss the entrepreneurial ecosystem prevailing in their respective countries and try to gather the best of that taking place in different countries.

The competition promises to bring out new ideas and formulate revolutionary revenue models in the Web and Mobile Apps Spectra which are yet to be ventured.\n[\n11\n]\nGuest Lectures\nE-Cell addresses the latter through  the various Guest Lectures which are conducted as part of GES. Talks by various authorities on entrepreneurship are conducted, as they serve as motivation as well as guide-posts for aspiring entrepreneurs. Some of the speakers in this platform include:\n[\n12\n]\nArjun Malhotra\nCo-founder,\nHCL Technologies\nand Chairman,\nHeadstrong\n;\nVinod Dham\n, Inventor of the\nPentium\nChip\n(\nFather of Pentium Chip\n[\n13\n]\n);\nSanjeev Bhikchandani\n, Founder,\nNaukri.com\n;\"\nAlok Patnia\n, Founder at\nTaxmantra.com\n\",\nK.D. Singh\n, Founder, Alchemist Group;\nSunil Handa\n, Serial entrepreneur, Faculty,\nIIM Ahmedabad\nand Management\nGuru\n;\nPadma Shri\nAnil Gupta\nFaculty,\nIIM Ahmedabad\n,\nPadma Shri\nAwardee (for distinguished achievements in the field of management education);\nSramana Mitra\nForbes\nColumnist and Strategic Consultant;\nDominique Trempont\nBoard of Directors\n, 3Com, Finisar, Energy Recovery Inc., associated with\nSteve Jobs\nas CFO of NeXT;\nAnand Sen\n, Vice-President,\nTata Steel\n;\nRashmi Bansal\n, Writer of books such as\nStay Hungry Stay Foolish\n.\nWorkshops\nWorkshops\ntend to have a large impact on the task encouraging the spirit of entrepreneurship in young minds. These workshops focus on a wide variety of topics and aim at building a broader understanding of new forms of innovation and analysing the key challenges posed to entrepreneurs. They typically address some of the critical issues faced by entrepreneurs like Business-plan writing and funding one’s own venture. Other technical and non-technical areas like\nRisk Management\n,\nFinancial Analysis\n, opportunities of innovation and entrepreneurship available in certain sectors, are also taken up. These workshops are conducted annually by organizations like\nIntel\n,\nNovell\n,\nCII\n-Sorabhji\nGodrej\n, Seeders,\nWipro\n(WiCamp) etc.\nKnowledge Camp\nKnowledge Camp\nis held annually within the Institute and aims at encouraging  students to interact among themselves regarding new emergent technologies and business issues like alternate energy, finance, carbon trading etc. The topics chosen are from those in which there is active research with applications in industry and at the same time general enough to invoke interest. \nA typical Knowledge Camp session would begin with the introduction of the topic, declared well in advance, followed by presentations by speakers. Every member is by default invited to make presentations, with the liberty of content and duration. While the delivery is on, the topic is open to the house for questions and to add to any of the subtopics covered. Although they need not be after rigorous research or core calculations, such content is more than welcome. A reliable source is acceptable for discussions as well as presentations.\nIt provides a learning platform for students from all disciplines and areas irrespective of their year of study. Presenters include students and research scholars presently working in the fields.\nFund-a-\nKGP\nian\nAlumni of IIT Kharagpur are a very important source of funds for development projects within the Institute. Taking this into account, E-Cell has a unique programme by which it recommends to the alumni network, certain good ideas that students of the institute have come up with. These entries are then scrutinized by the respective alumni, who then help finance or mentor these ideas, as they develop into a full-grown company.\nInnovation Platform\nInnovation Platform (IP) is a platform provided by E-Cell for those students interested in starting-up. Entrepreneurial ideas are invited from the First Year students of the Institute, and the best among these, selected by professors, are then provided with funding by TIETS and mentoring by the professors. This takes place alongside the regular academic course, so that when the students leave the Institute at the end of their fourth- or fifth- year, as the case may be, their idea grows into a company that can face the stiff competition in the real world. Some of these ideas, related to product designing have been awarded the coveted\nKishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana\n(\nKVPY\n) scholarship, offered by the Government of India.\nAchievements\nRajendra Mishra School of Engineering Entrepreneurship\nThe\nRajendra Mishra School of Engineering Entrepreneurship\n, IIT Kharagpur was started in the year 2010, largely due to the efforts of E-Cell. This is the first school in India, which imparts entrepreneurial education at college level. Students of IIT Kharagpur have the option to take up the M.S. course offered by SoEE, alongside their regular B.Tech course, and upon successful completion of the both the courses, are awarded a Dual Degree (B.Tech.+M.S.). \nUnder this course, students have subjects which, unlike MBA courses that deal with corporate management, help them in the specific task of management within a startup, which is quite different from the former. In the fifth-year, students are provided with funding up to Rs. 1 Lakh and also mentoring and incubation to enable them to develop their own company.\nDeferred Placement Programme\nDeferred Placement Programme (DPP) acts as a cushion to those who want to pursue with their entrepreneurial idea after completion of their study in the Institute. Under this programme, if the student does not wish to take up a campus placement offer, he/she can pursue with their startup, and if, after a period of one year, they wish again to take up a job, may attend the campus-interviews in the year subsequent to that of their passing out.\n IIT-Kharagpur is the first institute to offer this programme at Undergraduate-level.\nKairos Society\nThe\nKairos Society\n, a US-based not-for-profit student-run organization\n[\n14\n]\norganizes an annual Summit on Entrepreneurship. In the 2010 edition of this summit, the Indian team consisted of four members from E-Cell. Furthermore, the delegation was formally endorsed by Mr.\nSashi Tharoor\npersonally.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nReferences\n↑\nhttp://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-05/news/34926566_1_fms-students-e-cell-student-activities\n↑\nhttp://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-21/indore/35952856_1_iit-k-entrepreneurship-awareness-drive-iit-kharagpur\n↑\nhttp://www.stepiitkgp.in/otheractivities.html\n↑\nhttp://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/about_us/portfolio\n↑\nIIT Kharagpur event comes to NIT Rourkela\n↑\nhttp://www.iitkgp.ac.in/sric/\n↑\nhttp://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/events/esummit/\n↑\nhttp://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/events/ead\n↑\nhttp://www.khemkafoundation.org/awards/social-entrepreneur-of-the-year/2008-finalists/arbind-singh-nidan\n↑\nDrayton, Bill.\nhttp://www.betterworld.net/quotes/entrepreneur-quotes.htm\n↑\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152564437703266&set=a.137744623265.142018.129788793265&type=1&theater\n↑\nhttp://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/events/guest-lectures\n↑\nhttp://www.neaiuv.com/ourppl_vinoddham.htm\n↑\nhttp://www.kairossociety.com/about/about-kairos-society/\nExternal links\nIIT Kharagpur\nEntrepreneurship Cell\nGlobal Entrepreneurship Summit\nScience and Technology Entrepreneurs' Park, IIT Kharagpur\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Entrepreneurship_Cell&oldid=17817\n\""

You may substitute this with a flat plate and rolling pin. Keep in mind that roti makers are difficult to find abroad.\nSmall plastic containers to store spices\nLunch box\n* Casserole\n* Clips (metal or plastic) to seal open packets\nFood\nDepending on availability at the location and weight vs cost consideration\nRice (~4kgs)\nFlour (~3kgs)/Instant Rotis\nOats\nDaal, green gram\nSpices: chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric, mustard seeds, cumin powder\nSalt and sugar\nInstant Noodles/Pasta/Upma/Poha/Dosa mix\nCurry masalas/Sambar mixes\nPickle\nYou may also carry some onions if you've space, they won't spoil and can save you the hassle of immediate grocery shopping.\nClothes\nPair of formals\n2-3 pairs of jeans and some t-shirts\nThermal inners, if you're going to a cold country\n5-6 pairs of undies, socks and/or inners\n2-3 sweatshirts and jackets, gloves, scarfs, mufflers depending on the climate there\nFormal shoes, regular shoes, sandals, heels\n1-2 Bedsheets and pillow cases\nPersonal Care\nSoap, face and hand wash, shampoo, toothpaste, conditioner, razors, shaving gel, moisturizer, lip balm and other toiletries.\nDetergent, dish wash, scrubber.\nSanitary napkins, if applicable.\nHair equipments like comb, clips, bands, clutches, etc\nCosmetics, if any.\nStationery\nA book, pen\n* Journals or diaries\n* Books\nMiscellaneous\n* Needle and thread\nUmbrella\nSpectacles/contact lenses\nForeign currency\nThis is absolutely necessary to be done before you depart. SBI at IIT Kharagpur can supply Euros, Pounds and USDs. For other currencies, you may have to go to SBI, NRI Branch, Kolkata. You may carry converted currency as a mix of cash and foreign travel card or cash alone. Irrespective of how much balance you've on your card, always carry some liquid cash. In case you're carrying a card, before you leave the branch, make it absolutely sure that they activate it. In case you've a long transit at any other country, please carry the respective currency as well.\nIt is worth noting a few common points:\nUS Dollars are accepted at several airports and can be converted to almost any currency across the world. So, if you think you are being fleeced for the conversion at SBI IIT Kharagpur, you can convert INR to USD and then convert the USD to your destination country's currency at your destination airport\nThe\nSBI Multi-Currency Foreign Travel Card\nis very useful. It is accepted\nthroughout the world\nand can be used at ATMs in your destination country to withdraw the local currency. This allows you to carry enough currency to last you 2 or more months because you can use ATMs instead of having to carry actual currency.\nA foreign travel card is also very useful for buying food and other necessities during travel. In several western countries, you might even be able to get by without withdrawing cash at all. (Even though having a minimum amount of cash is always recommended)\nHow much cash is enough cash?\nDepending on the country, and your arrangements, you may have varying expenses such as transit from airport to your accommodation, rent/safety deposits, daily/monthly transit passes, grocery shopping, etc. Take into account these initial expenses and carry enough cash to sustain until your intern payments. Discount for differences in cost of living between India and the respective country.\nAfter you reach\nImmigration and Work Permit: These procedures should be done when you enter the foreign country. You'll be required to produce the visa documents, and will be issued a work permit if they're fine. Be sure to keep safe any immigration document that you might be issued.\nGetting a SIM card: You may want to obtain a SIM card at the city where you will be living. However, most developed countries have WiFi at public places, transit stations, etc. Most often, your work place will have WiFi too.\nOpening a bank account: This is mandatory for some employers. Advantages include cashing pay checks, issue of local debit/credit cards, etc. Note that banking in India is different from banking in other countries. So, while opening your account, request the bank to help you get thorough with the particulars.\nGetting a transit pass*\nGetting a medical insurance: Don't lapse on this. Most often, your university or employer may have a medical insurance that you may be accommodated into.\nReferences/See also\nThis list is based on personal recommendations.
