Founded in 2005, copies of\nThe Scholars’ Avenue\nwere initially delivered to all the students on campus, with soft copies being mailed to the faculty and several thousand alumni all over the world.\nEach of the issues is a juxtaposition of the informational, the technical and the creative. ScholsAve reports campus events and happenings, functions as a public interface between students and the administration, summarizes technical advancements taking shape on campus and not the least, prints the funnies. Its pieces include:\nEditorials\n: The editors’ take on the successive issues that have affected IIT Kharagpur’s campus.\nInterviews\n: Interviews with luminaries such as Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Kris Gopalakrishnan, Prahlad Kakkar, KK, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia et al.\nGuest Articles\n: Featured articles from guests.\nCareers Avenue\n: A stab at increasing the horizons of the readers.\nTech Avenue\n: On-campus technical advancements in the spotlight.\nBhaat Avenue\n: Browse through our biweekly dose of humour.\nThe team is drawn entirely from the students of the institute and acts as the voice of the student community by reporting on events relevant to campus. TSA is also a non-profit organization independent of the administration of IIT Kharagpur and is supported by sponsorships and donations.\nEarly Days\n\"There have always been dreamers; because in our dreams we see not what is, but what can be. There have always been doers; because through our efforts, we make what-can-be what-is. This is how things become possible. This is how the quality of our life improves. Because we dream. Because we do. - Daewoo Motors\"\nThe Scholars' Avenue (TSA or ScholsAve) was borne out of one such dream. A dream to give IIT Kharagpur its own newspaper that would act as litmus for the mood on campus and provide a medium that students could capitalise to voice their views. It started off in 2005 with an aim to reach every single room on campus via print issues and soon forayed into online media with the establishment of it's website.\nQuite a number of issues in, The Scholars' Avenue raised the issue of the condition of the B. C. Roy hospital and reported about a strike within campus. Amidst misunderstandings, major decisions were made which included a ban on the Scholars' Avenue and curtailment of its website. The ban lasted less than a month and TSA decided to no longer stay under the Gymkhana – a move that made it free to decide its content but also left it financially crippled.\nThe Website\nThe Scholars' Avenue also has a large readership on their website where news is not the only thing that gets published. They also do a number of articles on different genres as listed below.\nInterviews\nA number of interviews are conducted whenever any major personality is in Campus, during elections, and various other situations that would be of potential interest to the KGP populace.\n||\nLink to the Interview Section\n||\nGuestAve\nGuestAve is an open section where anyone, from a fresher to The Student Senate can publish their articles from, after approaching the team.

        "content": "Introduction - Why IPFS\nSometimes, users might required to add PDF files in a wiki article. But files generally consume a lot of space on the server. Hence, a simpler solution would be to upload the PDF somewhere and put its reference link in the article. General solution might be to upload a PDF in one's cloud storage accounts like Google Drive or Dropbox. But there are chances that in future the link to the file may be broken due to reasons like user's account getting banned or user deleting the file accidentally. So, it is necessary to have a place, where the PDF is uploaded permanently, and link is valid forever.\nIPFS\n[\n1\n]\nsolves our problems here. IPFS is a peer to peer file storage system. A file uploaded in IPFS cannot be deleted\n[\n2\n]\n. So, the link in the article will never be broken. This article follows a step by step guide on how to upload a file using IPFS and access it using a link, which can be put in the wiki article.\nStep by Step guide\nVisit the site -\nhttps://anarkrypto.github.io/upload-files-to-ipfs-from-browser-panel/public/\nClick on\nCHOOSE FILES\nbutton and upload the file\nClick on the Upload at the bottom of the page, as shown\nhere\nOn the Right hand side, in a grey background text area, you can see a JSON with key names - path, hash, size.\nCopy the hash value to the clip board, as shown\nhere\n.\nThe file can be viewed at the URL\nhttps://ipfs.io/ipfs/HASH_WHICH_YOU_JUST_COPIED\n, as show\nhere\nYou can reference the above link in the wiki article.\nNot Just PDF files, you can also upload images, videos too.\nFurther Reading\nIntroductory video on IPFS\nIPFS docs\n↑\nIPFS Powers the Distributed Web\n↑\nCan I delete my content from the network? - Help - discuss.ipfs.io\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Link_PDF_files_as_links_in_metakgp_wiki_(using_IPFS)&oldid=146291\n\""

This course don't have very much concepts rather you need a decent practice to grab the topic properly. Also you need to remember a good amount of theorems and formulas which you should be able to apply at proper place.\nDuring the course, if you want to study from books. Then it is strongly recommended that you follow only one book because you may find different conventions for Fourier transform, Inverse Fourier transform,Fourier Sine transform,Inverse Fourier Sine transform etc.  in different books.This thing can even effect the answer of some questions. Therefore follow the convention from one book and practice accordingly.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nFor exam, firstly you should practice class problems well. After that you can practice more questions from tutorials.If you do these two things properly and have clarity in your concepts, then your job is done.It is more than sufficient to score good marks in this course and you even don't need to study any book.\nDuring the exam, mention clearly your convention for Fourier transform, Inverse Fourier transform,Fourier Sine transform,Inverse Fourier Sine transform etc. before solving any question.\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\n14ME Batch Course Repository\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nNR422,NR321,NR421,NR322\nNR422,NR321,NR421,NR322\nTuesday\nNR422,NR321,NR421,NR322\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=MA20101:_Transform_Calculus&oldid=59598\n\""

The IIT Kharagpur branch of 180 Degrees Consulting (abbreviated as 180DC) was founded in April 2020 by Amritash Bharadwaj, Nikita Kishore, Adarsh Gupta, Aniket Shah and Keshav Godala with an aim to provide quality consultancy services to socially conscious corporations and NGOs to help them achieve the impact they seek to create.\nBeing students of the oldest, largest and most versatile of IITs, the team consists of driven and capable people with diverse skill sets across various fields. It is a platform where students can gain leadership skills, consulting experience and professional etiquette with a chance to derive value through the quality of their collaborative work.\nFunctioning\nSelections\nSelection procedures for 180DC are held at the start of the autumn semester. New recruits are taken in from the first year only. The selection procedure consists of multiple rounds of interviews and discussions wherein prospective members aren’t judged on their knowledge of consultancy frameworks, but rather their problem-solving approach and whether they are able to present their thoughts in a structured manner.\nThe selection procedure evaluates the candidates on\nStructured Thinking, Problem Solving, Work Ethic, Time Management, Speaking, Writing and Design skills\n. Good knowledge of business and finance is appreciated but is not the main factor of evaluation. We expect an optimal amount of time and dedication.\nTraining Sessions\nThe main opportunity to learn in 180 Degrees Consulting is via training sessions. Seniors organise these sessions to polish the skills of new recruits and also teach them various consulting techniques and frameworks. These knowledge meetings also involve case study competitions/workshops.\nOrganisational Structure\nAdvisors\nconsist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the organisation.\nDirectors\nare members who are in their third year of study. They are responsible for heading various different portfolios and projects within the organisation.\nExecutive Heads\nare the members who are in their second year of study. They are responsible for executing the portfolio and project work assigned by the Directors.\nConsultants\ncomprises the students who are in the first year. They take care of executing various plans and projects of 180DC\nAdvisors and Directors\nAdvisors (2024-2025)\nAditya Dubey\nRoshni Biswas\nSourashis Chattopadhyay\nSamyak Jain\nSushant Jha\nSagar Kumar\nRishabh Mishra\nJagori Bandyopadhyay\nVeeransh Mehta\nSudeep Bhurat\nDirectors (2024-2025)\nShristi Singh\nParag Agarwal\nGaurav Jindal\nAtaullah Baig\nAbhishek Das\nVihar Davuluri\nSreelekshmi Kishore\nAdvisors (2025-2026)\nSushant Jha\nSagar Kumar\nRishabh Mishra\nJagori Bandyopadhyay\nSudeep Bhurat\nShristi Singh\nParag Agarwal\nGaurav Jindal\nAtaullah Baig\nAbhishek Das\nVihar Davuluri\nSreelekshmi Kishore\nExecutive Directors (2025-2026)\nAkshat Mittal\nMoulik Mishra\nVideh Jha\nAnushka Mukherjee\nGargi Bhagwat\nArghyadip Pal\nOur Work\nProjects\nThe organisation’s work includes client negotiation, acquisition, onboarding and providing consultancy services to clients. The services include (but are not limited to) evaluating project feasibility, providing financial and CSR strategies, doing market research & data analysis etc. The deliverables provided have helped several NGOs and organisations in many ways like helping them getting more funds, solving infrastructural/systemic problems, acquiring more volunteers etc.\n180DC has collaborated with various renowned organisations, some of them are listed below:\n1) Child Rights and You (CRY) Foundation\n2) Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India\n3) Trumio\n4) Robin Hood Army\n5) Mahila Saksham Foundation\n6) World Vision India\n7) Government of Madhya Pradesh\n8) Genesis\nSome of the top feedback which we have received from various clients:\n1) Government of MP\nClient Feedback:\n“180 Degrees Consulting IIT Kharagpur was of immense help in making policies to recover revenue loss faced by the Madhya Pradesh Government due to COVID-19 pandemic. Their way of working is very organised and innovative. All the consultants we’d interacted with were very hardworking, inquisitive and enthusiastic. They found to be quick to grasp the requirements and work accordingly. We appreciate their efforts and applaud their dedication, they have made a huge difference.”\n2) World Vision India\nClient Feedback:\n“The performance and practical insights provided by the team of 180DC IIT Kharagpur in the unemployment report was of immense help while planning programs in rural and urban areas of various cities. Consultants were equipped with knowledge of ML and Data analytics and handled large youth databases of 2000+ youth with utmost professionalism to provide us with data-backed insights. We hope to collaborate with 180DC for future projects.\n3) Robin Hood Army\nClient Feedback:\n“We found 180 Degrees Consulting, IIT Kharagpur works to be very impressive and phenomenal.

There are two options to cope up with the course:\n1. if you miss classes, go for video lectures on NPTEL (very boring) and give at least 3 days to this course before exams.\n2. if you go to classes and understand the course as explained by the prof, no need to check video lectures.

It is organized in both summer and winter and at various places like Kareri lake trip, Dharamshala , Manali ,Dodital lake , Delhi etc.\nPrevious Treks\nHar ki Dun\nThe Trek From Taluka To Gangad\nMost trekkers know Har Ki Dun for its culture and history and trek to only Har Ki Dun but end up missing out on the beauty and variety the Ruinsara Tal has to offer. This is one of the most underrated sections of the trek. In less than five minutes of starting your trek, you find yourself on an undulating trail right beside the Thamsa river. You are constantly under a canopy of fresh green. Quaint old wooden bridges across the river appear out of nowhere giving you great picture opportunities. You cover miles on this trail without breaking a sweat. You’ll notice that the coniferous forest gets denser as you go further. The narrow trail snakes through this dense dark forest for a good hour before opening up to the traces of civilization — the ancient village of Gangad. We are not used to such leafy starts on treks. It was almost like a walk in a picture-perfect pine tree park.\nSwargarohini- The Way to HEAVEN\nYou never hear trekkers talk about any campsite on the Har Ki Dun trek. Like everyone else, I assumed Kalkatiyadhar to either be a small settlement or just beside it. Quite contrary to my expectations, Kalkatiyadhar turned out to be a vast green meadow. What blew me away was the expanse of the valley. We were in the middle of multi-level cricket-field-sized meadows, set at a vantage height. To my distant left, the trail climbed towards Swargrohini peaks, which were just peeking on the horizon. To my far right were dense jungles with mountains rising behind them. This was the trail to Ruinsara. To my right across the river was a meadow set amidst a boundary of pine trees. Behind me, I could trace the trail all the way down to Seema and even see the Kedarkantha summit miles away behind Kotgaon.\nThe stories of the ancient villages\nA lot has been said everywhere about the ancient villages of Har Ki Dun. You spot these villages from a distance, spread out on the mountainside, with houses almost hanging in the air. I could not wait to climb up to them and see what the interiors looked like. Spending a night in the village home takes you back hundreds of years. The stories of the village elders and the smiles of the youngsters are something that you want to capture and take back with you. The villages complete the famed Har Ki Dun experience. On our trek, you get to stay in at least two different villages – Gangad and Osla. Flowering bushes border the meadows throughout while tiny colorful flowers grow from the ground almost everywhere in spring.\nHar Ki Dun and Ruinsara Tal valleys\nI loved the expanse of the Har Ki Dun valley. The valley has everything going for it. Big snow-clad mountains towering right in front of you. A big river flowing right in the middle. Lovely green meadows stretching far and wide. I could sit there and just take in this scene the whole day. Ruinsara Tal on the other hand feels like a faraway world. The isolation grips you. It’s just you, the mountains and the lake. Looking at the mountains reflecting in the clear blue lake had a big calming effect on me. Devs Thatch turned out to be the best-kept secret of the entire Har Ki Dun – Ruinsara trail. You hardly see much of this meadow from anywhere else but when inside it. The secret is indeed well wrapped around by pine trees! I loved the meadows because they flow down from top to bottom for 600 meters and stretch for almost 2 km in length.\nKedarkantha\nIt was on the 2nd of May when the sun at the east was peeping out behind the clouds, and we were waiting for a few to join us. It was 9 a.m. on the fresh summer day. They finally arrived and we departed, in a train which took us to Dehradun. We then took a bus to Sankri. Accompanied by a group of enthusiastic people on the bus, we played Truth or dare, bluff, and Mafia with them. Despite our expectations, we developed a very good bond at the earliest. On the way, in our exciting journey, we were amazed by the scenic beauty of the Yamuna river and the wide-spread Pine forests. Meanwhile, the bus stopped. YES! We reached Sankri. Our joy bound no words. We kept our luggage safe in our base camp and got ready fast to start our first summer trek.With no further delay, we all began. Our minds were all set with the aim of completing the trek within a few hours. Eventually, we felt exhausted during the journey and thought to rest. But then we realized that we had just finished a single kilometer! In Spite of the exhaustion and debilitation, our seniors motivated us to keep our spirits high. A part of our team who were playing songs was suggested to enjoy vocals and visuals, by a senior, instead of using electronics. Meanwhile, one of our friends shared a bagful of gummy bears with us, which really helped us to take easier breaths at higher altitudes. After climbing planes and rocks, we reached a checkpoint-a mesmerizing lake, hidden between the snow-covered majestic mountains, offering scenic Himalayan landscapes - JUDA KA TALAB. Greeneries around were enhancing the grace of Heaven. Nearby the lake, we encountered a hut-like place, where we were served hot Maggie to satiate our hunger. We continued our move. At a point in time, we realized that most of us were suffering mild headaches and the reason wondered us all because we had crossed 9000 ft !!! It was dusk and we decided to camp. The location was a semi-snowy ground with green trees around and we all worked together to make our tents. Yep! Our tents were ready and then it was bonfire time! However, gathering sticks was a hectic task. One of the seniors, who had been to almost 10-12 treks, narrated us horror stories. We were thoroughly enjoying the moment with chit-chat commentaries. We then decided to doze off under the twinkly sky lit up with a million stars, admiring how the Milky Way was spewing its milk across the sky.Our next wonderful day started at 4 a.m.After staying there for a long while, we decided to descend. We decided to enjoy it to the fullest as we were then aware of the path. Few of us slid the snowy steeps. It was undoubtedly fun. It was dusk again and we were again into tenting and chit-chat mode, sharing our memories with each other which multiplied the happiness. Next day of descending started with hesitation at dawn because the water was damn cold that none literally dared to touch it. We continued the descent. We were almost back to the bottom and noticed our tanned skin blaming the hot sun. Eventually, it was dusk again and we made our tents ready. We engaged our chit-chats with interesting games. We played Uno, True or Dare, and a few more. Again our chit-chats continued very long that we legit ended the conversation discussed Egyptian Mythology.

After the long admiration, carrying the peaceful vibes, we continued on our way to the top of the peak. Yeah! We finally did it. We reached a place which is least intervened by humans. Our cheerfulness bound no words. Everything around was eye-catching. We were admiring each and every moment and we clicked lotta pictures there thereby saving those moments. We also found a beautiful Lord Shiva idol which added more bliss to the place. We worshipped with complete serenity. We were still glaring at the vast, widespread mountains. All of us were sunk in the awe of the marvelous scenery. After staying there for a long while, we decided to descend. We decided to enjoy it to the fullest as we were then aware of the path.

Our trip came to an end and it was time to return back. We were cherishing the moments with memories but still were with a heavy heart to leave the magnificent place. Those stilled memories in cameras and phones will stay evident for our entire lifetime. This gist of our Kedar Kantha journey puts us in Nostalgia and YEAH!

The essential idea is to bring you away from the conventional Free Body Diagram approach to more mathematical and an indirect approach to quantify the stability of the aircraft at times when you cannot draw FBD.\nStudent Opinion\nIf course taught in right way or atleast if one try to understand this course by investing genuine efforts. Then this is the course where AI and ML are used extensively used by various industry and startup since one has to use neural network to calculate coefficients used in the equations .

        "title": "Illumination",
        "content": "Illumination\n(also popular as\nIllu\n) is a tradition followed by every hall of residence at IIT Kharagpur during the Diwali festival every year. Large grid structures (called\nchatai)\nmade of bamboo stripes are used as a framework on which wire loops are mounted to support earthen lamps, known as Diyas. The Diyas form a pattern based on a theme decided by the respective student hall. The event is attended by students from different halls of residence, alumni, faculty, and guests of honor from outside the institute. Judges are selected from amongst the faculty and take multiple routes to visit the different halls, starting at the\nTechnology Students' Gymkhana (TSG)\n.\nOn the day of Diwali, prior to the arrival of the chief guests, judges, and other officials, mounted Diyas are lit up to showcase the intricate pictorial description. Based on the Illu theme for a given hall, it is decorated using backlit panels (handmade from chart and Diyas), ornate flower patterns, and symbolic Diya arrangements.\nPreparations for Illu starts several weeks before Diwali and involves active collaboration between the residents and staff of a hall, with a separate committee often being formed from the senior batches to develop designs, strategize, and execute the event.\nThe Origins of Illumination\nBack in 1981, certain innovative students from the\nAzad Hall of Residence\ndecided to celebrate Diwali by lighting scores of Diyas on giant chatais. In characteristic fashion, the\nNehru Hall of Residence\ndecided to make a\nGeneral Championship\nevent out of it- calling it the Bigyan Sinha Memorial Cup. Up to the year 2013, the top 3 halls were chosen for the best showcases by the Gymkhana (TSG) and were awarded a pot of Rasgulla. While the competition was dropped in the year 2014-15, the student community continued celebrating Illu with the same zeal.\nThe\nRangoli\nevent is synonymous with Illu, where large sand art pieces are designed and created using Rangoli powder. Most halls produce designs that measure in excess of 80 square meters.\nStyles\nOver years, each student hall has developed a unique art style, each highly anticipated for the theme and execution style. For example, the\nRajendra Prasad Hall of Residence\nis known for their negative solid-filling style of the\nchatais\n, while Azad Hall is known for elaborate mythological-themed designs. Several halls have begun incorporating ultraviolet colors into their Rangoli designs, rendering different images when viewed under normal light and ultraviolent light.\nGallery\nPreparations for Illumination\nThe buddha, ILLU 2014\nRangoli made by colors in LBS Hall, 2014\nILLU celebration in LBS Hall, 2014\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Illumination&oldid=185326\n\""

        "title": "Competitive Programming",
        "content": "This article has been originally written during the winter of 2019-2020. While there are many articles and resources on the internet on \"How to start with competitive programming\", this has been written keeping in mind some of the dynamics of IIT Kharagpur, and to save students from\nParadox of Choice\n.\nWhy Competitive Programming?\nDid you like solving hard math problems, or olympiad problems in your high school? If that's so then chances are that you will like Competitive Programming too. While there are a few benefits from competitive programming, like getting noticed by recruiters and enhancing your problem solving skills, for many it is a hobby to many who like to feel the spirit of a problem solving competitions and the adrenaline rush that comes with it.\nInstead of writing the whole article from scratch, I will just attach the necessary, and sufficient resources needed.\nResources in KGP\nI'm amazed at the number of anynomous queries, on fundae page, saying that KGP lacks resources for Competitive Programming. I guess, for some reason the resource are not well known. So let's list all of them, once and for all.\nWhatsapp group : Yeah there exists quite active Whatsapp group for Competitive Programming.\nWhatsapp Invite for CP Interview Group.\n: Do not join the latter group, if you're preparing for interviews, as the discussion most of the time is on topics not needed for interviews.\nWhatsapp Invite for Regular CP'ers\n- link broken\nCodeX IIT Kharagpur Fb Group\n: If you have any doubt, or even if you want help with debugging. If you're posting your question correctly, there are (100 - e)% chances that it will get resolved. (e is infinitesimal)\nCP Mentor-Mentee Program\nGrimoire of Code\n: Competitive Programming Society of IIT Kharagpur. Also posts interesting problems every other day.\nCompetitve Programming Workshop\nby Codeclub.\n2021\nCompetitive programing workshop videos\nby\nGrimore of Code\n. Div-1, Div-2, Div-3 seperate playlists.\nBasic Information\nProblem Solving\nThere are lot of programming websites where you can practice competitive programming.  Almost all of them follow the same format, where you are given a problem, and you have to write and submit code that will solve the problem. Your solution will be checked on some test cases and you'll be given a verdict depending on, if your program outputs to all the test cases correctly, or not, or if it ends up having a segmentation fault.\nProgramming Websites\nSpoj\n: Spoj is a problem archive. It has many easy problems to help you, if you are just starting with competitive programming. You can sort the problems by number of submissions, and solve first few  (say 25 or 30 or 50) problems. The problem with Spoj is that, after sometime you will find it boring because problems here are repititive, and finding good problems is difficult here. This is the website where you can find the classical problem (problem that asks you to directly implement a standard algorithm or trick) for any algorithm.\nCodechef\n: If you're just begining with competitive programming, you can right away start with Codechef's. It holds atleast three contests a month. The best thing about codechef is its Long challenges, which are aimed for beginners. Each long challenge starts on first friday of every month and lasts for 10 days, and therefore you get enough time to think about problems, debug the codes, and search the internet to learn related things. It also hosts two short contests, Codechef Cook off, and Codechef Lunchtime. Lunchtime consists of more mathematical and ad-hoc problems.\nCodeforces\n: This is the most used competitive programming website. It has a lot of features, including problem ratings, virtual contests, gym, mashups, and better problems. It hosts 5-6 short contests every month. Once you are familiar with problem solving on codechef, start solving problems on codeforces too. Start participating in contests here, once you gain some confidence. Comparing to interview problems, almost no interview problem is harder than Codeforces Div2D.\nAtcoder\n: It holds contests quite irregualry, but the quality of problems is far better than any of the other programming platform. Start solving problems here, once you are comfortable with codeforces problems, and wants to improve your problem solving skills.\nInterviewbit\n: This website contains minimal problems to get you acquainted through Competitive Programming needed to crack interviews, if you are short on time. Once you are familiar with basics needed for Competitive Programming, and want to prepare for interviews, this is the place you should head to.  Even if you are already too good at Competitive Programming, I would suggest you to solve interviewbit to get a taste of problems that are asked in interview.\nLeetCode\n: If you want to solve more interview-related problems on some specific topics other than the ones on interviewbit, then LeetCode covers that for you. It contains a lot of problems that were asked in previous interviews of companies.\nRoadMap\nLearn Basic syntax\nLearn the basic syntax of any programming language until loops, functions, recursion, struct. You can choose any programming language to begin with, java, python, C, C++. This article will mainly focus on C++, as it is used by most competitive programmers.\nC++ is superset of C. If you haven't learnt C yet, then you can directly start with C++.\nC Video Playlist Hindi\n,\nC Video Playlist English\n,\nC slides\nYou do not need to learn classes and their properties in C++ for competitive programming. The part of C++ that makes it far more usable than C in CP is the vast variety of contains and algorithms in Standard Template Library. But before moving to that, just learn input output syntax in C++, and most of the rest is almost same as C\nWhat now?\nThe first thing you should do before you start solving problems is to learn about\nTime and Space Complexity\n. It's always a good idea to calculate the time complexity of your algorithms before you start implementing it. A rule of thumb is that 10^7 operations can pass in 1 second on any programming judge, but if you're not using any of the costly operations like modulo, and overhead of your program is less, then 10^8 operations may pass too.\nNow you're all set to solve problems. Go through this well-written\narticle\nby Triveni Mahata, and try to solve almost all problems from it.\nIf you want to learn some algorithm or some topic, you can find a list of tutorials here\nCodeMonk Hackerearth\nInterview Preparation\nIf you've solved most of the problems in the above article, then you already have had a taste of competitive programming problems, and know about basic uses of STL.\nIf you want to prepare for Interviews, this should be enough to get you going through most of the problems on interviewbit. Directly start solving problems from interviewbit, but make sure to finish almost all problems in the above article before that. Once you're done with interviewbit, you can move on to LeetCode for further practice, and I'm pretty sure, that it is enough for cracking almost all interviews.\nThe article further focuses on, how to improve further in Competitive Programming. If your sole aim is to prepare for interview, you can still practice more problems on codeforces  but that is not necessary at all.\nPlease make sure you check out the\nInterview Blogs Archive\nby CodeClub, IITKGP\nImproving beyond basics\nSo now, you've already solved enough problems from the blog, and you really liked solving problems. But the problem is that you still get stuck at solving even easy problems.\nLearn more algorithms and techniques from\nPrepare Codechef\n's Advanced section.\nDo not stop participating in long challenges and other codechef contests just because you are learning new topics. This ideology, almost never ends well.\nYou can find tutorials to almost all algorithms and data structures at\nCP-agorithms\n.\nStart participating in codeforces contests too.\nIf even after solving so many problems, you still can't get Div2C AC during contest time. Do not worry, we all have been there.\nStart solving problems from\nDiv2 C Ladder\n.\nOnce you are comfortable with problems from Div2C Ladder and you're able to solve most of them without much effort. Start solving\nDiv2D ladder\n.\nIf you've solved most (around 50) problems of Div2D Ladder, and you're still not improving, then do not worry. Let me assure you that you're too close to rating 1800-1900. It is just a matter of time. Keep solving.\nBeyond 1800\nA lot of people in KGP are stuck at around 1800 rating on codeforces. Once you reach the 1800 bar, you know almost all there is to know to reach 2100. The only thing that you need to train now is your problem solving skills. While the gap in rating is just 300 points, it is certainly more hard than getting to 1800 from 1500.\nAnd as I have experienced over time, only people who have been doing competititve programming regularly, and participating in atleast every other contest, have been able to reach 1900 and manage it for a couple of contests.\nWhat problems to solve?\nJust solving contest problems regularly will keep you busy. If you still get time, then there are a whole lot of problems on Codeforces, just filter them by your current rating + 100, and keep solving. Here are some other resource to solve problems.\nCodeforces Ladders by Rating\nAtcoder CheckList\nIOI CheckList\n: If you want to solve some good quality ad-hoc problems, then solve the problems in USACO checklist at the bottom.\nCodeforces Mahsups\n: You can add the problems you want from codeforces and create a mashup contest.\nVjudge\n: Here you can give your customised virtual contest with problems from different judges.\nMore Resources\nCP Resources\n: Contains resources for some advanced algorithms and data structures.\nCP FuckUps\n: Contains non-trivial behaviour, or errors. If  you too find some non-trivial error while solving problem, send a pull request.\nAlgorithms Resources\n: Contains some materials for purists to go through. Old classics still seem pertinent in most cases.\nPiece of Advice\nChecking for correctness of your algorithm is not necessary, but is highly recommended. It not only helps you in figuring out the corner cases, but also in getting more insight into the problem. And, I'm pretty sure if people knew that this ability grows so quickly over time, more people would be doing it.\nDunning-Kruger Effect\n, and the fact that it applies to Competitive Programming so well, is my favourite thing to talk about.\nThe origin is the point, when you start Competitive Programming, and find it so hard, that you may take hours, and sometimes days to debug your code. Everything seems so new, every problems seems to use a different algorithm, and you feel like you do not have talent needed to excel in CP. But as soon as you solve enough problems, you start observing the patterns, and you realise that most problems are just ad-hocs, using some trivial data-structures.\nThe peak point is when you are rated 1700-1800 on codeforces. You think that you know all there is to know, and that you rating doesn't represent your true level. Your rating is low just because you miss some problems in contests during the last minute, or you couldn't debug it before the contest ended. No Karen, your rating represents your true level, if you think that it doesn't then increase your rating. Numbers don't lie.\nThe minima comes when you're just on the boundary of purple and blue. You are afraid to give any contest because that might decrease your rating. So you avoid participating, because you think that you do not deserve to be purple, it is just purely by chance. Participate in contests. Even if you lose rating in a few contests, you will gain it back. You deserved it :)\nDon't fall prey for Dunning-Kruger Effect :)\nImprove your implementation skills. Be time efficient in short contests, have clear thought process.Upsolving is the most important. Make sure you have breadth knowledge of theory. DO NOT focus more on rating (be patient :)). Learn several DS,ALGO to take a deep dive into CP.\nFAQs\nI am not able to improve even after solving a lot of problems. What should I do now?\nChances are that you are solving only easier problems, until you start solving problems that are outside your comfort zone chances are high that you will not improve. Or, it might be the case that you're only under the impression that you're solving problems, while most of the time you're just scrolling through codeforces blogs, and choosing a problem. In that case, see the number, for they never lie :) . How many problems did you solve in the last month? 20 is not a good answer, if you're saying that you're practicing regularly. But I must mention that even if you're solving a lot of problems, and that too outside your comfort zone, you may not see any improvement. In that case keep patience.\nmy cf-rating graph\nEventhough I was practicing a lot during my third semester, I was stuck in between cyan and blue (mostly on the cyan side :( ), but soon after I had a steep curve, which I did not expect at all. These times come with lots of demotivation and self-disappointment but that's how it works, you cannot improve in a day. You have to give it time.\nHow much time should I spend on a problem?\nMy advice is to spend time on a problem as long as you find it interesting. It's only when you start finding it boring, go for the editorial.\nWe want to build this FAQs section. So, if you have any other questions that you want me to answer, then feel free to ping me on\nfacebook\n.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Competitive_Programming&oldid=239695\n\""
