Excellent as a kick-start to DSA, but very mundane and basic for someone wanting to get well acquainted to the same. TAs are a little less proficient though when it comes to C programming, but are helpful in clearing your fundamentals about a particular problem, as is Prof. Sourav Mukhopadhyay.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nSubmit the lab assignments on time and you'll be fine. The lab exams are pretty basic, however one needs to be wary of cases where there is a good chance of the program faltering.\nClassroom resources\nHave a look at the basic questions on every data structure and algorithm on Geeks for Geeks, and practice it before hand.\nAdditional Resources\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nPC_lab-II\nPC_lab-II\nPC_lab-II\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=MA29005:_Design_%26_Analysis_Of_Algorithms_Lab.&oldid=96695\n\""

Unsourced material may be challenged and\nremoved\n.\nThe Viterbi-India Program is a fully funded program which provides opportunities to undertake a research internship at the University of Southern California for a period of 8 weeks in the summer. The Viterbi-India Program is a result of the partnership between the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum and the Viterbi School of Engineering, University of Southern California. Every year around 20 students are selected from colleges and institutions all over India. The selections are made based on the applicant's profile and attitude towards research which include CGPA, research interests, previous research experience and technical skills, and additionally, expectations from research.\nEligibility\nThe program is only open for Indian students pursuing a Bachelors or a Masters degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Sciences or Computational Sciences, at any recognized institution of higher education in India.\nApplication Procedure\nThe application process generally starts from August ever year. A notification is put on IUSSTFs website and colleges are notified. Often posters are put up in the respective departments. The application procedure involves filling a digital form, acquiring Letters of Recommendation and emailing the completed form to the mentioned address.\nFilling up the application form involves writing page long essays about one's research interests, technical skills, previous research experience, purpose of the internship and what one would gain from the research. The application also asks for the names in order of preference of at most three USC professors, whom the applicant would be interested in working with.\nAcceptance Notification\nThe notification of acceptance generally comes as an email between late January and February. The final list is published only after the selected candidates have accepted the internship. The official offer letter is mailed by mid March.\nPost Acceptance\nStipend\nCurrently the scholars receive a lump sum of $2630 in cash and traveler's cheques before leaving for the US. The remaining $370 out of the total $3000 as mentioned in IUSSTFs website, is utilized for health insurance at USC. Return air tickets are arranged by the IUSSTF and the cost is borne by them.\nAll the expenses including housing and food for the 8 weeks stay in the US are to be borne by scholars from the above mentioned amount, which could be managed provided the scholars spend responsibly.\nLocation\nUSC is located in Los Angeles (LA), one of the most of popular cities of the USA, also famous for hollywood. Los Angeles has excellent public transport, making is easy and convenient to move within the city. Though the USC campus and its neighboring areas are patrolled by security personnel, crime rates are on the higher side in the USC and LA neighborhood, and one must be careful while staying out at night.\nHousing\nScholars are responsible for finding their own housing. Most interns stay in subleased apartments. Subleases can be easily found by visiting facebook pages listing sublease ads. Facebook groups formed by the scholars also turn out to be extremely useful sources of information.\nVisa\nOf late, owing to the repurcussions of the pandemic, the application process for the US visa is very cumbersome. It is extremely difficult to get appointment slots at the Consulates for weeks together, and the awardees are advised to be on their toes in ensuring that they get through the visa process. The application process is clearly listed on the US immigration and travel (ustraveldocs) website.\nSee also\nHow to get a visa to USA\nList of internship programs\nExternal Links\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Viterbi-India_Program&oldid=177406\n\""

The inaugural session was started with the introductory lecture by Prof. B K Prusty (President, TMES), Prof. Khanindra Pathak (Head of Department, IIT Kharagpur) followed by the guest lectures of Mr. Harsh Sachdev  (Managing Director at S&T Mining Company Pvt. Ltd.), Mr. Subhasis Das (Vice President & Head at Sandvik Mining and Rock Technology, India), Mr. Subhash Niyogi (Marketing Director at Korman Rockster GmbH, AUSTRIA) and Shri Subir Kumar Mukhopadhyay.\nThe presence of our distinguished alumni in the fest took the events to the new heights- Shri K.B. Biswas (Member (ED & MM) of Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has been appointed as officiating Chairman of CGWB), Mr. P K Sinha (Chief Managing Director at Orissa Minerals Development Company (OMDC)),Mr. Bibhas Chandra (Vice President at Indian Mining Cunsultency Pvt. Ltd.,Kolkata).\nAnd eminent guests are Mr.Deepak Pandya (Dy. General Manager at Coal India Limited), Mr A.K.Srivastav, Mr Sagar Khetia (Executive Assistant and Reverse Mentor on Digital to Senior Leaders,Tata Steel).\nEvents such as Sarvekshan, Petro Case study and Enviro Case study saw a huge participation of the geo-mining students of the country. Geobotics and Industrial Design tested the integration of theoretical and practical knowledge of future leaders of this industry.\nMineac and Quiz Spiel, the quizzing events were undoubtedly the most likely and thoroughly enjoyed events. National Mining Innovation Challenge witnessed the amazing raw talent and creativity of the fresher of IIT Kharagpur through working models and presentations. The overall environment during the fest was encouraging, stirring and exhilarating.\nEvents\nGreat Step 2016\n(New Events Added)\nNATIONAL MINING INNOVATION CHALLENGE\nThink a innovative idea which can be implemented in Mining and Allied Industry .Here you have to present your innovative idea it may be paper or model presentation during event.The idea must have following feature :1. It must be innovative. 2. It must have some application. 3. It must be related to field of mining.\nSARVEKSHAN\nSurvey,Map,Execute….Few important stands of an Engineer…This event provides an insight into planning part of an engineer and hones the planning skill of participants. The event will challenge the students to apply classroom knowledge of surveying in order to solve a real problem. The event will simulate the surveying problems in real conditions.\nGreat Step 2015\n(New Events Added)\nENVIRO CASE STUDY\nWith the success of other case studies, GREATSTEP came up with ‘Enviro case study’. It is a case study competition where participants have to come up with a sophisticated and complete solution about environmental problems faced in mining industry. Even though this competition was held for the first time, it was participated by large number of teams and a fierce competition.\nOPTIMIZAIRE\nThis was the event where participants were to come up with some peerless solutions to optimize the production in mining and other related industries. Many great ideas were discussed along with some detailed questioning by the judges which gave the participants an insight of its importance in today's industries.\nCREATIVE DESIGN PROBLEM\nIt was an exhibition event where participants were required to present new / innovative ideas in the form of a presentation or model. It saw some of the great presentations of raw talent from the freshers of IIT Kharagpur.\nGreat Step 2014\nGEOBOTICS\nGeobotics is a manual robotics competition; students are given with an industrial problem which can be solved by using robotic implementation. GREAT STEP witnessed some new innovative designs and strategies by the participating students to overcome the problems given at hand.\nINDUSTRIAL DESIGN PROBLEM\nIt is an overnight event and the problem statement is given on site. The participants have to pass a preliminary round to compete in the final round. The participants seemed enthusiastic and thrilled about this overnight competition as they would be exchanging idea and design of a prototype model in one night and bringing them into reality.\nMINEO CASE STUDY\nMineo case study is a case study competition where participants have to come up with a sophisticated and complete solution about a mining industry situation. The competition is to present the idea in front of panel of 8 judges and answer their question. This event was participated by large number of teams and audience, as it broadens the thinking of a mine planning and development.\nPETRO CASE STUDY\nPetro Case Study is similar to Mineo Case Study but about petroleum industry rather than mining. The participants were equally aware and active about this competition. It turned into a healthy competition and discussion among faculty and students.\nMINESHOT\nMineshot was another new event; an online event and it saw an enormous participation from all parts of the country from mining and non mining students. It was a photography competition where the participants had to upload a mine related photo and the winner would be decided by the number of like the photos gets on Facebook and its relevance. These photos were posted on official page of GREATSTEP 2016.\nMINEINDITE\nMineIndite is yet another presentation competition where the participant has to present a paper developed by themselves about particular topic in the subject of mining engineering. This event witnessed the most number of\nparticipants.\nMINEAC\nMineac is a quiz competition where participants form a team. The quiz is based on overall knowledge regarding Mining, Petroleum and Geological Science. The participants as well as the audience showed interest and enthusiasm in this event. This event was very thrilling and ended up with closed gathering discussion between professors and students. The event drew up 150 participants.\nTEE DESIGN\nThis event was aimed at increasing the awareness and importance of mining engineering through T-shirt.

        "content": "About the Department\nThe Agricultural and Food Engineering Department\nwas established in 1952, as the Agricultural Engineering Department on the recommendation of the Dhar Committee appointed by the Board of Governors, IIT Kharagpur in 1950. Subsequently on the upgradation of its academic programme, the department was renamed as the Agricultural and Food Engineering Department in 1994. Among the sixteen IITs, IIT Kharagpur has the sole distinction of having an Agricultural and Food Engineering Department.It conducts annual fest named Prakriti to create a platform for sharing ideas about agricultural developments from all over the country.\n[\n1\n]\nAchievements\n[\n2\n]\nTractor drawn combination tillage implements\nTractor drawn combination tillage implements are developed which can prepare the seed bed with less time, fuel and number of passes as compared to conventional tractor drawn tillage implements.\nEducational and design software\nThe department has developed a few window - based interactive software packages for use as teaching and research tools. These include Decision Support System for estimating Reference Crop Evapotranspiration (DSS_ET), Hydrologic Calculator to perform various hydrologic analyses and Soil Conservation Structure Designer to design various soil conservation structures. DSS_ET includes more than 20 ET estimation methods. It estimates ET and ranks applicable ET estimation methods based on data availability and climatic condition.\nImproved device for wet soil preparation\nThe traditional method of rice cultivation in wet soil requires 5-6 times ploughing by bullocks. The time and energy spent by man and animal has been found to be greatly reduced by the use of IIT Puddler. The machine can be pulled by a pair of bullocks and can cover 1 hectare area in a day.\nMechanized production of Indian milk sweets\nProducts like �Chhana', is the base material used for preparation of several Indian sweets like rasogolla and sandesh. A technology has been developed for continuous production of chhana by using helical tube heat exchangers and a whey separator. Sandesh, a delicious milk-sweet can be produced continuously by using a screw kneader and a vented single screw extruder. Untouched by human hand, the product attains greater shelf-life than those available in markets.\nTea cultivation in non-traditional area\nTea is conventionally cultivated in sloping lands and foothills. The department has developed technology to successfully cultivate tea in plain lands and wastelands by adopting appropriate land slope, drainage, plantation of shade trees and pressurized irrigation. With these management practices tea can be grown in lateritic plains and wastelands.\nImproved tractor seat\nA tractor seat having 18.9 N.mm-1 spring constant and 1.09 N.s.mm-1 damping coefficient has been found to reduce significantly the vibration and bring comfort to the operator. The seat has been field tested and recommended for Indian tractors.\nLow-cost polyhouse technology\nPolyhouse has been constructed for cultivation of off-season crops at controlled temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide inside the structure as per the requirement of the crops. The house can also be used to raise seedlings of vegetables and flowers. It is made of locally available bamboo and GI poles, mild steel flats and ultra-violet stabilized plastic films.\nAir-recirculatory tray dryer for fruits and vegetables\nIn an air-recirculatory dryer, a part of the exhaust air is recycled along with the ambient air. This gives higher thermal efficiency and produces dry products having low surface hardness and improved colour and flavor characteristics. The developed dryer can produce 2-3 kg dry products in about 6-7 hours. The technology has been transferred to SSP Ltd., Faridabad.\nRecycling of waste into compost\nWaste materials generated from agricultural, forest, aquatic, domestic and industrial sources are recycled and converted into compost. Different microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria and earthworms have been used as compost accelerators. The technology has already been transferred to Shewood Agrotech to commercially produce solid Vermicompost and liquid Vermiwash.\nBiodiesel production from non-edible oils\nA suitable process along with a processor has been developed to produce biodiesel from nonedible oils such as Jatropha, Karanja, Mahua, Simaruba with high free fatty acids. The processor comprised a reactor, chemical mixing tank and a settling funnel and it can handle 10 liters of oil per batch. The yield of biodiesel is around 98% and the fuel properties of biodiesel so produced are within the biodiesel standards prescribed by India, America and Europe.\nMicrobial enzymes in food\nVarious technologies are developed and transferred to use microbial enzymes for clarification of apple juice, debittering of pomegranate juice and polishing of germinated brown rice.\nResearch & Development Facilities\n[\n3\n]\nFarm Machinery & Power\nThe discipline has developed modern Tillage & Traction lab, Tractor testing lab, Ergonomics lab and Biofuel lab.

        "title": "Openvpn on institute proxy",
        "content": "Following this article, you can create your own personal VPN server at the cost of $0.005/hr ($3.6 per month) on Amazon Web Services Free Tier. A maximum of 2 users can connect to this VPN.\nCurrently, there are many available Free VPNs which we can connect using TCP 443 protocol. And we get decent internet connection speed using those. Problem with that VPN is that if the load on the server hosting the VPN increases resulting in poor internet connectivity. And mostly the VPN servers that we connect are hosted outside our country, resulting in poor ping while gaming as well.\nLet's get started:\nFollow this complete tutorial (read the Note before following the instructions in the tutorial) to setup your OpenVPN server\nlink to the tutorial\n.\nNote\n: Do not forget to change your server location Default is N. Virginia change it to Asia Pasific (Mumbai). And while doing ssh use Mobile Data connection.\nWhen you will SSH You will need to enter the preferences for your OpenVPN server.\nWhile entering the preferences just go by default values\nexcept in some places\n, when you are asked : Please specify the network interface and IP address to be used by the Admin Web UI: [Select] 1. Should client traffic be routed by default through the VPN? : [Select] yes. Rest all will be default values.\nNow when you will try to connect the VPN server with your institute wifi it will not work. You need to make some changes in the config file.\nLets say the elastic ip of your server is 13.234.132.123. Now go to the openvpn server page\nhttps://13.234.132.123\n(your Elastic IP). And click on Yourself (user-locked profile) at the bottom to Download the config file.\nOpen the .conf file in any Text editor now we just need to focus on the lines 40-64 in the .conf file. This will look something like this:\nsetenv FORWARD_COMPATIBLE 1\nclient\nserver-poll-timeout 4\nnobind\nremote [Your Elastic IP] 1194 udp\nremote [Your Elastic IP] 1194 udp\nremote [Your Elastic IP] 443 tcp\nremote [Your Elastic IP] 1194 udp\nremote [Your Elastic IP] 1194 udp\nremote [Your Elastic IP] 1194 udp\nremote [Your Elastic IP] 1194 udp\nremote [Your Elastic IP] 1194 udp\ndev tun\ndev-type tun\nns-cert-type server\nsetenv opt tls-version-min 1.0 or-highest\nreneg-sec 604800\nsndbuf 0\nrcvbuf 0\nauth-user-pass\n# NOTE: LZO commands are pushed by the Access Server at connect time.\n# NOTE: The below line doesn't disable LZO.\ncomp-lzo no\nverb 3\nsetenv PUSH_PEER_INFO\n5. Now you need to change this portion of the file to look like the syntax shown below:\nsetenv FORWARD_COMPATIBLE 1\nclient\ndev tun\nproto tcp\nremote [Your Elastic IP] 443 tcp\nresolv-retry infinite\nnobind\ntun-mtu 1500\ntun-mtu-extra 32\nmssfix 1450\npersist-key\npersist-tun\nauth-user-pass\ncomp-lzo\nreneg-sec0\nverb3\n6. Now in your OpenVPN application upload this config file and configure the proxy as well and Now you will be able to connect and use the VPN. Using this you can play games as well, like PUBG And Dota. Ping for PUBG was about 100ms, which is quite good.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Openvpn_on_institute_proxy&oldid=96645\n\""

        "content": "Welcome to Metakgp, and thanks for considering contributing to this wiki! We are glad to have you. We hang out on\nSlack\n, do drop by to say hi :)\nChanging the content on any page or creating a new page is called\nediting\n. Editing Metakgp wiki is really easy.\nQuick start\nMost of us have never edited a wiki before, and it can be quite scary to change an existing page, or create a new one. Don't worry, it's actually quite simple to do.\nGo to any page, and click the \"Edit\" link near the left of the search box. This will load Visual Editor, which is a very friendly and intuitive interface for editing.\nTo create a new page, type the name of the page into the search box. The search results will give you an option to create the page.\nBefore making decisions such as how to write acronyms, phone numbers, names of people etc, please visit the\nConventions\npage.'\nWhere to begin\nReady to edit, but not sure what you should write about? Here are some suggestions to help you get started:\nMake a page for your hall, society, club or student group. How many people does it have, and what makes it unique? (eg.\nDebating Society\n)\nAdd an article about your research/internship program. Was it interesting? What challenges did you face, and what do other people need to know about it? (eg.\nBEST\n)\nShare some KGP lore. Do you know any interesting things about the place we live?\nTell us how to get things done. Did you have to manage a difficult situation -\nDepC\n,\nSummer quarter\n, or something else? We want to know how you did it!\nLook at\nYellow Pages\n, and add a phone number for a service – it's really useful to have them all in one place!\nFinding your way around\nThis wiki has a lot of powerful options, but it can be confusing initially. Here are some useful links to know about:\nRecent changes\n: This handy link on the sidebar will show you an overview of everything that's changing on the wiki. Really useful to see which pages are seeing activity, and what edits are being made.\nTalk pages: Every page on the wiki has an associated Talk page, where you can leave comments. This is useful for having a discussion about the content on the actual page. See\nHelp:Talk pages\n.\nUser pages: You have your own page on this wiki –\ncheck it out\n! You can add information about yourself, or anything else you want, on this page. For example, many people find it useful to add handy links or snippets of text that they want to be able to access from anywhere, to their user page.\nUploading and displaying an image\nThis wiki can display any image from\nMediaWiki Commons\n. To upload and display a new image:\nUpload\na new image to MediaWiki commons. Make sure you have the rights to this image – either it should be yours, or you need to have permission from the owner.\nOnce you've uploaded the image, you can click on\nInsert -> Media\nin VisualEditor to insert the image anywhere on the wiki.\nIf you need to use the image in an infobox, you can refer to the image by filename directly.\nTo transfer images from flickr first\nchange the license\nto an\nappropriate free license\nand then use the\nflickr2commons\ntool. You will need to give the userID of the photographer or photoset ID or photo ID to transfer the image. You can get to know your user ID\nhere\n.\nFor more information, check out\nMediaWiki image help\n.\nEditing source\nSometimes the Visual Editor doesn't have the full set of features that wiki markup offers. In those rare cases, click on\nEdit source\n, and take a look at the excellent and short\nWikipedia editing tutorial\n. If you still face problems, don't hesitate to contact any of the\nadmins\n. Some pages, like this one, don't have Visual Editor enabled, and you must edit the source.\nSyntax help inks\nFormatting\nWhat is Metakgp about?\nMetakgp is a community driven wiki. KGPians are the editors of Metakgp, and no official organisation or student body controls it. The most active editors generally end up having the largest say in the wiki's policies. To understand why we think this wiki is a good idea, check out\nAmrav: Why metakgp?\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Help:New_editor%27s_guide&oldid=238646\n\""

Most of the course is based on Estimation theory and Prof. Anirban teaches it exactly as is from Steven Kay's SSP book. Estimation theory is mainly about inferering the parameters (population parameters) from a set of observable data and infering the parameters that influence their occuring. As the course under Anirban follows the book completely, it is really easy and straightforward to learn. SSP is a very fun course where one can expect to strengthen one's knowledge on Probablity and Signal Processing together. Prof. Anirban rarely talked about examples in real life where SSP can be of use, but the book does a very fine job in exposing the applications.\n-- Arun Patro (EE '18)\nHow to Crack the Paper\nThe mid-semester paper is usually easy and covers simple concepts taught in class in the form of sums. There are a few derivation based questions in the paper as well which can be found in the example section of the chapters covered in the Steven M. Kay. It is advisable to go through the sums given in the class as assignment problems. It is also recommended to get hold of the previous year question paper from a senior as it is not available in the library website. Some problem patterns can be inferred from them, which helps in narrowing down the focus of preparation. The mid-semester paper is usually scoring.\nThere is a single class test held which has a weightage of  10 marks and the other 10 marks comes from the assignment submission. The class test is usually tricky which tests some basic concepts and the pattern of sums set are not available in the book. The end-semester paper consists of 6 questions of 10 marks each. Adequate time is available to complete the paper. Revising the assignment sums and previous year paper is useful. It is advisable to thoroughly revise the example sums from the Steven M. Kay for the portions which has been added new to the syllabus compared to previous years.\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nAn Introduction to Statistical Signal Processing Volume I (Estimation Theory) by Steven M.

It was earlier referred to as the 'English Technology Dramatics Society', ETDS in short. It is under the Technology Students' Gymkhana and is a part of the Dramatics Subcommittee under the Social and Cultural Committee.\nFunctioning\nSelection Procedure\nENCORE selection auditions are held once per year, only for first years, in August for an active membership for all four/five years. The society selects a batch of 30-40 first years (UG) and 5-10 (PG) at the beginning of the academic year soon after the welcome production. Selection procedure consists of tasks that judge voice modulation, intensity, speech and diction, confidence and acting skills.\nIn rare cases, exceptional and highly enthusiastic people are also inducted into ENCORE who share a similar passion of theater and contribute to the society. Past members who were inducted include Kaustabh Khare.\nThe Governors for the year 2015-16\nOrganizational Structure\nENCORE has four governors selected by the society seniors every year who govern the society and represent it in the Gymkhana. Overall co-ordination during productions, outstations and competitions are handled by the governors.\nList of Activities\nCut by Ed Monk was performed for the welcome production for the year 2015-16.\nWelcome Production\nWithin two weeks of the Autumn Semester starting, ENCORE performs its first production of the year. The cast ranges from second years to fifth years. Over the years it has been observed that ENCORE generally picks up comical plays and sketch comedy to entertain the freshers. This is also the first time the Governors for the new tenure are introduced to KGP.\nAn Impromptu act by Mudit Rustagi and Kartikeya Pradhan for the Welcome Production by Encore in 2013.\nMonoacting the invisible man by Mayank Das.\nFreshers' Workshop\nThe freshers are given a thorough training of theatre oriented workshops that teaches them the basics of dramatics. Skills like voice modulation, voice intensity, dramatization, body posture, stage movements, third forms, etc are taught in groups. First years along with the four governors train for three weeks at the Vikramshila Foyer (commonly referred to as Baap Ki Jagah by the ENCORE fraternity). Occasional skits, monologues, and challenging impromptu are attempted to improve the versatility of the actor. For tenures in which a PG Batch is also inducted, separate workshops are conducted for them.\nFreshers' Production\nThe freshers' production in 2015-16.\nThe Governors with the help of the entire society train the first years and with rigorous practice put up a production, with the entire cast being first years. For tenures in which a PG Batch was also inducted, a separate production is done by them.\nNukkad Natak\nNukkad Natak is the only event during the entire year when ENCORE does a play/street play in Hindi. Only the second years take part in the Nukkad Natak competition organized during SpringFest.\nRangmanch\nThe final monologue by Leela Benare played by Abhivyakti Dixit.\nENCORE also participates annually in the Stage Play event of SpringFest i.e. Rangmanch.\nAnnuals\nThe last act of the year (referred to as the Annual Production) is performed during End-March to Early-April.

This is part one of the Micro Economics course and as such only covers half of the essential topics in microeconomics. The other important topics such as theory of cost and market structure are covered in Micro Economics-II. Unlike the syllabus mentioned in ERP, theory of cost and all types of markets are in Micro Economics-II and not Micro Economics-I.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nPractice all the proofs done in class and remember all the conditions and assumptions taken (this will help in true/false with explanation type questions in exam). Practice all tutorials again before exam. Solve questions from Intermediate Microeconomics by Hal R. Varian or Microeconomics by Pindyck and Rubinfeld.\nMicroeconomics by Hal R. Varian is the primary book for the course and it is one of the bestselling books in introductory microeconomics. However, this book is insufficient for exams because it explains concepts without going into the mathematics behind them. It is advisable to refer to a book like Microeconomic Theory: A Mathematical Approach by Henderson and Quandt for mathematical portions. This book expects basic knowledge of economic concepts and it would not make sense unless you have a grasp of theory from an introductory economics book.\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nBooks referred to in course\nIntermediate Microeconomics by Hal R.

It participates with consistent success in\nParliamentary Debates\nacross the world, and had organized the IIT Kharagpur Model United Nations Conference and the IIT Kharagpur Parliamentary Debate in previous years. In 2020, a team from KGP DebSoc went on to become\nthe first all-Indian team to reach the ESL (English-as-Second-Language) finals of Australs\n, one of the most prestigious debating tournaments in the world.\nIn 2024, a team from KGP DebSoc emerged as the\nwinners of ESL (English-as-a-Second-Language) finals of Uhuru Worlds\n, one of the biggest and most prestigious international tournaments.\nCampus events and tournaments\nSelection process\nThe Debating Society is always looking for smart, enthusiastic debaters, and takes in new members all year round. There is no restriction on the year of study, and members have joined as late as 4th year. However, to provide more structured training, and to spread awareness, it holds Fresher Selections and Senior Selections at the beginning of the year. This is followed by a training workshop, which lasts about a month, where newcomers to parliamentary debating are taught various facets and nuances of structured argumentation.\nRegular activities\nThe Debating Society tries to meet at least two times a week for practice sessions. These are usually conducted in the foyer of the Main Building, with multiple debates often happening around the place. University-level competitive debates have two preeminent formats - the 3v3 Asians Parliamentary Debate, and the\nBritish Parliamentary Debate\n, which has four teams of two in a single debate.\nIn addition to foyer debates, it participates in national and international debating competitions all year round. Members choose their own teams or decide to adjudicate. Participating at many high-quality tournaments is regarded as the way to excel, and members are supported by the society for things like getting permissions from professors, and reimbursement of expenses.\nOther events conducted include the Intra-KGP Debate Tournament and the\nFoundation Day\ndebates.\nHistory\nDebating Society member Sanat Mehrotra conducting the freshers' workshop on 18 August 2013.\nKGP Debate Club\nAlthough students have been arguing at IIT Kharagpur for over half a century, the activity was only institutionalized in 2009 as a part of the 'KGP Debate Club'. It was founded by Sumeet Mohanty (BT '11) and started as a loose affiliate of the\nTechnology Literary Society\n(TLS). The KGP Debate Club began its activities on campus as an active interest group and marked IIT Kharagpur's entry into competitive parliamentary debating. Membership was not exclusive - meetings and debates were open to all and were held in the institute foyer. There were only a handful of members in the Autumn of 2009 and almost all the early recruits were from TLS. The NLSPD 2009 in Bangalore was the first tournament at which the KGP Debate Club represented IIT Kharagpur. This was followed by participation at NUJSPD 2010 by a team of freshers. The Debate Club held its first open selections prior to this tournament, and all the participants for the tournament were selected here.\n[\n2\n]\nIncorporation as a Gymkhana society\nIn Autumn, 2010, the KGP Debate Club was formalized as a full-fledged Gymkhana society independent of the TLS. The first governors were Achyut Bihani (BT '12), Shikha Singh (MA '13) and Anand Kr (CS '12).\nEarly in the Autumn of 2011, the number of governors was increased to four, and the KGP Debate Club was rechristened as 'Debating Society, IIT Kharagpur'. Two of the Governors - Adarsh Mathew and Prashanth Durai - commissioned a logo for the society, and it was created by Avik Dey. In the same semester, the Debating Society and\nSpring Fest\nagreed to jointly conduct IIT Kharagpur's first-ever Model United Nations Conference. Thus, IIT Kharagpur Model United Nations Conference was founded with Prashanth Durai as the first\nSecretary-General\n.\n[\n2\n]\nList of governors\n2010: Achyut Bihani (BT '12); Anand Kr (CS '12);
