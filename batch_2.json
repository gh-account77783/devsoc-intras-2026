When these boarders went to cast their votes in the evening, they were told\ntumhara vote daal diya hain, abhi chale jao\n.\nInforming the election coordinator\nAfter noticing this, an application was written by one of the fourth years from Azad Hall. This application was signed by ~16 people from the hall who faced the same situation. This application was submitted in person to the election coordinator for the year.\nNo further action was taken.\nAftermath\nThe elections, which elected Shovan Panigrahi as the Vice President of Gymkhana, were considered to be valid. No re-elections were organized.\nFrom the next election season, i.e from Spring 2017, voting was centralized. All students are now required to go to the Gymkhana or one of the other polling centers to cast their vote. Polling booths are no longer established at the halls of residences.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=2016_Gymkhana_Elections_Voter_Fraud_in_Azad_Hall&oldid=23700\n\""

        "title": "Install MATLAB on a remote server",
        "content": "Context\nIf you have a piece of MATLAB code that requires high compute power, it is recommended that you take a remote server from the\nMeghamala Service: IIT Kharagpur\nand run your MATLAB code on the remote server. The following are the steps to install MATLAB on a remote server in KGP\nSteps\nGetting License: Since MATLAB is a proprietary software, installing it requires a license. You need to mail  [\n[1]\n] asking for the MATLAB license. You will receive  2 files named  -\nFIK.txt\nand\nnetwork.lic\nCopy those two files on the remote server using\nscp command\n.Copy the files preferably in the home directory.\nSSH into the server.\nDownload the Linux ISO image of MATLAB on the server using\nwget\ncommand. For example if you want to install MATLAB 2021B version, run the following command on the server.\nwget\nhttp://swrepo.iitkgp.ac.in/Matlab2021B/Linux/R2021b_Linux.iso\n5. Mount the ISO image on a directory(make sure that directory has enough space, at least 50 GB) using the following command. Here we are mounting  in a new directory called\nmathworks\ncreated in the the directory\n/media\nsudo mount -o loop\nR2021b_Linux.iso\n/media/mathworks\n6. In the\n/media/matworks\ndirectory, you will find many files. Among them, you will find the file called\ninstaller_input.txt\n7. Copy the contents of the file -\ninstaller_input.txt\nand paste them in a new file with preferably same name in a different directory(for example in\nhome\n). This installer_input.txt contains the MATLAB installation options, which need to be edited. The file is copied to a different location(like here\nhome\n) and edited there because one can't edit the installer_input.txt file in the mounted location -\n/media/mathworks\n8. Open the installer_input.txt present in home directory and edit the following lines\nYou can edit the options according to your usage. Here we assume that the machine username is ubuntu. Create a directory named matlab in home directory. We will be installing matlab in this directory. Hence path to this directory is the destinationFolder\ndestinationFolder=/home/ubuntu/matlab\nCopy the text in the\nFIK.txt\nfile,(file copied on the server in the second step) which is the format of xxxxx-xxxxx... and paste the key\nfileInstallationKey=12345-24564-.....\nagreeToLicense=yes\nLog files to check if installation is successful or not\noutputFile=/tmp/mathworks_ubuntu.log\nPath to\nnetwork.lic\nfile, which was copied on to the server using scp in the second step\nlicensePath=/home/ubuntu/network.lic\n9. Now to install matlab as per the above options, move to the directory\n/media/mathworks\n, where MATLAB iso image was mounted. To install run the following command\nsudo ./install -inputFile /home/ubuntu/installer_input.txt\nThe process will take some time. You can check the status of download at the file -\n/tmp/mathworks_ubuntu.log\n(Mar 16, 2022 18:16:44) Exiting with status 0\n(Mar 16, 2022 18:16:44) End - Successful\n10. To run matlab as a executable, add an alias in the\n~/.bashrc\nfile\nalias mat=/home/ubuntu/matlab/matlab/bin/matlab\nReload the session using the command -\nsource ~/.bashrc\n11. To check if matlab is installed or not, try running the command\nmatlab -help\nTroubleshooting\nSometimes the installation process fails because the directory might not have enough space. Please recheck the issue. From time to time monitor the log file.\nIn case of permission issues, try running the same command using\nsudo\nUsage\nTo run a MATLAB code on a long time, it would be a good idea to run the script in the background using a tool called\ntmux\n.\nFollow the steps.\nMove to the directory where your code is present\nOpen a new tmux session, using the command\ntmux new\nOpen MATLAB without desktop using the command -\nmatlab -nodesktop\nYou get access to MATLAB's command window\nRun the script you wish to run\nSave the workspace variables in a .mat file by runnning the following command in MATLAB command window -\nsave('script_vars.mat')\nscp\nthe\n.mat\nfile to your machine\nLoad the\n.mat\nfile on MATLAB, installed on your personal machine using -\nload('script_vars.mat')\nYou can now write code to analyse the data in\n.mat\nfile\nContact\nIf you face any issues while following the above instructions, feel free to contact Raghavendra Kaushik(\n[email protected]\n)\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Install_MATLAB_on_a_remote_server&oldid=169839\n\""

This event is hosted in cycle by one of the participating institutions.  At end of each Tech Meet the next host IIT is chosen by mutual consensus.\nTech Meet tries involves students to work on real life problems and pertaining to local issues and areas which require attention but are not extensively address through different platforms. Also it has elements pertaining to knowledge sharing and promoting collaboration among IITs.\nInter IIT Tech Meet comprises of ardent competitions, exhibitions, illuminating talks and exhilarating pro-nights that inspire, enthrall and mesmerize the massive hordes that attend. According to the pan-IIT Tech Board, “The Inter IIT Tech Meet is a consequence of students of various IITs coming together envisioning a progressive India. We realise that there are countless problems which our country faces due to its population, geographic expanse, climate, infrastructure etc. A lot of efforts are being put by various educational institutes for coming up with technology solutions which could address these issues. Numerous government policies and initiatives have created opportunities for promoting and encouraging the development of technology to address the issues. We feel that that IITs being premier education and research institutes must spearhead these initiatives. Enhanced collaboration between IITs would foster development of technology solutions and also encourage more and more graduating students to pursue this into full time ventures wherein they take this technology from research labs to end users, impacting a million lives.”\n[\n1\n]\nPrevious Versions\n[\n2\n]\n3rd Inter IIT Tech Meet\nIt was held at IIT Kharagpur from January 30th to February 1st, 2015.\nResults of the events:\nEvent\nGold\nSilver\nBronze\nCase Study\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Ropar\nIIT Hyderabad\nData Analytics\nIIT Kharagpur and IIT Mandi (joint)\n-\nIIT Kanpur\nProduct Design\nIIT Kanpur\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Bombay\nBusinness and Technology Quiz\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Mandi and IIT Guwahati (joint)\n-\nOpen Soft\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Hyderabad\nIIT Kanpur\nHardware Modelling\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Mandi\nIIT Madras\nMessier Marathon\nIIT Kanpur\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Guwahati\nModel Village\nIIT Bombay\nIIT Guwahati\nIIT Kanpur and IIT Hyderabad (joint)\nTotal points tally:\nIIT Kharagpur - 515 points\nIIT Kanpur - 265 points\nIIT Mandi - 157.5 points\nFurthermore:\nThe Application Cup was won by IIT Kharagpur with 235 points.\nThe Innovation Cup was won by IIT Kharagpur with 160 points.\nThe Knowledge Cup was won by IIT Kharagpur with 120 points.\n4th Inter IIT Tech Meet\nIt was held at IIT Mandi from January 30th to February 1st, 2016.\nResults of the events:\nEvent\nGold\nSilver\nBronze\nSocial Media Analysis\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Mandi\nIIT Madras\nInternet of Things\nIIT Madras\nIIT Kanpur and IIT Kharagpur\nIIT Patna\nTech Quiz\nIIT Ropar\nIIT Kanpur\nIIT Bhubaneshwar\nEmbedded Systems\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Kanpur\nIIT Mandi\nSoftware Development\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Kanpur\nIIT Mandi\nProduct Exhibition\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Madras\nPortfolio Defender\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Mandi\nIIT Madras\nHardware Modelling\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Kanpur\nIIT Roorkee.\nFinaL Standings:\nIIT Kharagpur\n5th Inter IIT Tech Meet\nIt was held at IIT Kanpur from March 25th to March 26th, 2017.\nResults of the events:\nEvent\nGold\nSilver\nBronze\nKharagpur Team Members\nHuman Computer Interaction\nIIT Roorkee\nIIT Mandi\nIIT Kharagpur\nRahul Singh\nPrerit Gupta\nSaurabh Dash\nAnurag Bharadwaj\nDashboard\nIIT Kanpur\nIIT Madras\nIIT Kharagpur\nAyush Goyal\nRameshwar Bhaskaran\nAthitya Kumar\nNaresh R\nIndoor Localisation\nIIT Guwahati\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Kanpur\nAdarsh Kumar Kosta\nAman Goyal\nAnurag Sharma\nAakash Yadav\nMarkovation\nIIT Roorkee\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Patna\nNaman Mitruka\nArka Baidya\nAshutosh Dwivedi\nEyes on the Sky\nIIT Kanpur\nIIT BHU\nIIT Guwahati\nKunal Deoskar\nHussain Bohra\nSiddhant Singh\nTokala Yaswanth Sri Sai Santosh\nCase Study\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Kanpur\nIIT Ropar\nAnubhav Goyal\nDarshita Chaturvedi\nRishabh Kumar Shrivastava\nStock Market Analysis\nIIT Mandi\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Roorkee\nNishant Nikhil\nSiddharth Muthukumar\nPranay Yadav\nSiddhant Singh\nAvijit Ghosh\nPareen Jain\nShubham Agrawal\nRaja Ambrish\nParas Tehria\nProduct Exhibition\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Kanpur\nIIT Ropar\nTeam A:\nHimanshu Chaudhary\nShivam Kumar\nRishabh Jain\nKumar Ankit\nTeam B:\nAman Goyal\nSaurabh Dash\nAdarsh Kumar Kosta\nUAV Design\nIIT Kanpur - A\nIIT Kanpur - B\nand\nIIT BHU\nIIT Madras\nV Srikanth\nBibhash Chandra Mitra\nAmanpreet Singh Arora\nSubodh Ranjan\nAtul Kumar\nFinal standings:\nIIT Kanpur\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Roorkee\nIIT Mandi\nIIT BHU, IIT Guwahati\nIIT Madras\nIIT Ropar\nIIT Patna\nIIT Gandhinagar, IIT Tirupati, IIT Bhubaneswar\n6th Inter IIT Tech Meet\n[\n3\n]\nSixth edition of Tech Meet was held at IIT Madras from 5th to 7th January, 2018. 6th Tech Meet introduced some profound changes with lot of industrial level problems being inducted into Tech Meet with senior engineers/scientists interacting with students and providing with practical problems relevant to the industry. \nThe sixth edition gained significant media attraction compared to previous editions.\nOverall Standings\n[\n4\n]\nIIT Kharagpur\nIIT Roorkee\nIIT Madras\n7th Inter IIT Tech Meet\n[\n5\n]\nSeventh edition was being hosted at IIT Bombay from 18th to 20th December, 2018.  First tech board meet with representatives from 17 IITs were held for first time for discussing upon the first formal draft of Tech Meet Constitution during 25-26th August, 2018, with primary agenda to shape Tech meet  into student driven platform for collaboration and exchange of knowledge at student level. Also, structural changes to how teams are evaluated as part of techmeet was changed compared to previous meet with teams coming up in the same bandwidth of performance (compared absolute marks) being awarded the same medal. The tradition of including industrial partners to give realistic problem was continued with Reliance Jio, BARC India, Drona Aviation etc as partners.  At the same time challenges which allowed institutes to focus on local level campus sustainability challenges and Agricultural challenge problems relevant to regions where individual IITs belonged were included in techmeet which was supported by Tata Centre, IIT Bombay. Several other academic centres also floated problems. Engineer's Conclave which included can be considered was poster presentation event of student projects from 19 IITs was an event that was scaled up 6th edition  and was an attractive part of overall event which was non-competitive. Also, Student Academic Conference(SAC) for undergraduate students was launched in 7th edition.

For example, to learn to play chess, if you knew the best move in every situation, you could train a supervised learning (SL) system with these ground-truth labels. If you only have an entire game followed by a win/loss binary signal, you could use reinforcement learning to learn to play in such a way that wins are maximised. Thus RL is more generally applicable than SL. For example,\nAlphaGo\nwas trained to play the board game of Go in this way, beating the world champion in a\nspectacular televised match\n.\nDeep Reinforcement Learning\n(Deep RL) combines reinforcement learning with deep learning, using deep neural networks to learn directly from raw inputs, without hand-engineered features or domain-specific heuristics. In 2013 DeepMind arguably kicked off the growth of the field by showing impressive results using Deep RL to\nplay Atari video games\n.\nResources by Deepmind\nSpinning Up in Deep RL by OpenAI\nIntroduction to Reinforcement Learning with David Silver\nReinforcement Learning: An Introduction\n.

The team designs, manufactures and tests Formula style prototype, single-seat race cars. It represents IIT Kharagpur at national and international Formula Student competitions,\nFormula Student, UK\nand\nFormula Bharat\n.\nAbout us\nThe purpose of the group is to develop formula student race cars. Formula Student is widely regarded as one of the biggest and most challenging student-level engineering competitions in the world. It intends to give students a great learning experience across all domains of engineering industry: design, manufacturing, project management, financial management and business planning.\nThe journey of each new car begins with its design. This involves application of all the classroom knowledge in actual engineering problems to achieve the set goals for the car and its different systems, through modelling, simulation and experimentation. The next challenge is to bring this design to reality, by checking the feasibility of various designs, fabricating different parts of the car through various manufacturing processes, and assembling them to the final stage. The last phase involves testing and tuning the systems of the car to rectify problems and achieve set targets.\nSupporting the car though this journey are the aspects of project management, cost planning,sponsorship and public relations. Effective project management is important to ensure that the entire production of the car, from designing, to manufacturng, to testing gets completed on time, and with positive outputs. Careful financial planning and management is required to ensure the best utilization of team's resources. Sponsorships are acquired from various industry partners to develop the team's resouce pool. Good public relations have to be maintained with various industry partners of the team, as well as with the team's supporters though meetings, social media and public events.\nAs a part of one of the events in the competition, the team also develops a complete business plan to launch the car as a product in the market. This involves performing an in-depth case study and presenting a plan on the business strategy, finance, production and marketing of a race car start-up company.\nThe activities of the group provide an all-round experience for its members to build a great skill set for themselves, and be a part of a team representing the institute at an international level.\nHistory\nIts foundation was laid in 2008. It was an outcome of efforts of a few enthusiastic founding members and faculty advisers. The team took a solid form with the support of Prof. PP Chakraborty (Former Director, IIT Kharagpur) and Prof. Sunando Dasgupta (present Dean SRIC, IIT Kharagpur).\nSidhartha Khastgir\nbecame the first Team Leader and stirred the team through the difficult initial stages where the team faced shortage of funds and technical knowledge.  Since then it has grown to become IIT Kharagpur’s largest student project encompassing around 70 students from 10 different departments. Ganesh Kumar M. became the second team leader and held responsibility for three years and oversaw the development of K-1 and K-2. Till date the team has successfully made five cars- the KX-1, the K-1, K-2, K-3 & K-4. K-2 competed at Formula Student UK 2013. Several design oversights in K2 were fixed in K-2.2 by a new chassis and intake-exhaust system; which competed at Formula Design Challenge 2015 (FSI 15).\nFormula Student\nFormula Student\nis Europe's most established educational motorsport competition, run by the\nInstitution of Mechanical Engineers\n(IMechE). Universities from across the globe are challenged to design and build a single-seat racing car in order to compete in static and dynamic events, which demonstrate their understanding and test the performance of the vehicle. The format of the event  is such that it provides an ideal opportunity for the students to demonstrate and improve their capabilities to deliver a complex and integrated product in the demanding environment of a  motorsport competition.\nFormula Bharat\nFormula Bharat\nis an engineering design competition in which students from colleges and universities all over India, compete with a life-size Formula-style vehicle in areas of engineering design, overall cost, marketability and dynamic performance. Being identical to the global student hosted in around eleven countries per year, the event encourages students to gain hands-on practical experience, while applying engineering theories studied in the classroom. It is hosted and managed by Mobility Engineering Consortium Pvt. Ltd., an organization dedicated towards hosting mobility-related competitions for students.\nCars\nKX-1\nThe KX-1 was the team's first effort to build a car. The X' in the name stands for experiment as the car was the very first attempt of the completely novice team. The car was powered by a\nHonda CBR600RR\nengine which has hence forth powered all the cars till K-2.2.\nKX-1\nThe team participated at Formula Student, UK 2010. The participation was however limited to static events. The team stood 9th in the cost report analysis, as the car was very cost effective in its design. The team was one of the six teams to be nominated for Airbus Teamwork Award.\nK-1\nThe K-1 was a major leap forward for the team. It was improved manifold from the first car. The car was powered by a\nHonda CBR600RR\nengine just like its predecessor. The team participated at Formula Student, UK 2011 with the car. However the team was restricted to participate only in the static events as the car had failed to clear the stringent scrutiny tests before the dynamic events. The team's impressive performance in the static events saw the team becoming one of the top three rookie teams at the event. The team again became one of the six teams to be nominated for the Airbus Teamwork Award.\nK-1 at FS UK\nGeneral\nOverall Length: 2400mm\nKerb Weight\n: 333kgf\nTyre Specifications: 167/77 R 13 36 Q\nWheel Rim Diameter: 13\"\nChassis\nMaterial: Tubular Seamless Carbon Steel\nFrame Weight: 45kgf\nFront Track: 125 cm\nRear Track: 118 cm\nEngine\nEngine Displacement: 599cc\nEngine Choice: Honda CBR600RR\nMaximum\nTorque\n: 66Nm @ 9000rpm\nFuel: RON 95\nSteering\n&\nSuspension\nSuspension Type:\nSLA Double Wishbone\nWheelbase\n: 1832mm\nSteering:\nRack & Pinion\ntype\nBrakes\nBrake Type:\nDisc Brake\nBrake Details: Multi-Piston with brake biasing\nCaliper\n: Fixed Caliper Type\nK-2\nWith a new car, theK-2, the team participated at Formula Student, UK 2013. The car was powered by a Honda CBR600RR engine just like its predecessors. There was significant improvement  in the car, a new plenum had been designed and manufactured in-house in rapid prototyping for better intake. New and more efficient SLA suspensions were implemented. It was the team's  most successful visit yet with the team clearing all the six scrutinizing inspections namely Tech, Safety, Chassis, Noise, Brake and Tilt, as per the rules & norms governed by the\nMSA\n(Motor Sport Association) and\nSAE\n(Society of Automotive Engineers). Out of the six Indian teams, TeamKART was one of the two teams to qualify for the dynamic events. The team competed in the endurance test. The team managed to secure 43rd position in Business Presentation and 45th in Cost and Sustainability Design Report and stood 67th overall among 120 participating teams.\nK-2 at Silverstone Circuit during FS UK\nK-2\nGeneral\nOverall Length: 2730mm\nKerb Weight\n: 280kgf\nTyre Specifications: 167/77 R 13 36 Q\nWheel Rim Diameter: 13\"\nChassis\nMaterial: Tubular Seamless Carbon Steel\nFrame Weight: 45kgf\nFront Track: 107.3 cm\nRear Track: 100.7 cm\nEngine\nEngine Displacement: 599cc\nEngine Choice:\nHonda CBR600RR\nEngine Intake: Plenum made by rapid prototyping of volume: 1.2 litres\nMaximum\nTorque\n: 66Nm @ 9000rpm\nMaximum\nBhp\n: 78.7W @ 13250rpm\nFuel: RON 95\nSteering\n&\nSuspension\nSuspension Type:\nSLA Double Wishbone\nWheelbase\n: 1832m\nSteering:\nRack & Pinion\ntype\nBrakes\nBrake Type:\nDisc Brake\nBrake Details: Multi-Piston with brake biasing\nCaliper\n: Fixed Caliper Type\nTransmission\nHonda Civic Quaife type Differential\nTorque biasing Limited slip differential with custom built housing\nChain and sprocket based final drive system designed\nK-2.2\nThe K-2.2 was the upgraded and improved version of K2. The car was powered by a Honda CBR 600RR engine. A consequential improvement could be seen in the car. A new impact attenuator was added and the intake diffuser, throttle body and air filter had been changed. A new Scorpion Carbon fibre muffler, which was the first carbon fibre part of the car was also introduced. The size of the radiator fan had also been increased for better performance. The team participated in\nFormula Design Challenge\n2015 and passed technical scrutiny. Although a seized engine prevented the team from taking part in the dynamic events nonetheless it was a great learning experience for the whole team. The team bagged the first runners up position in both, the Business Presentation and the Cost Report.\nK-2 at Silverstone Circuit during FS UK\nGeneral\nOverall Length: 2730mm\nKerb Weight\n: 270kgf\nTyre Specifications: 167/77 R 13 36 Q\nWheel Rim Diameter: 13\"\nChassis\nMaterial: Tubular Seamless Carbon Steel\nFrame Weight: 45kgf\nFront Track: 107.3 cm\nRear Track: 100.7 cm\nEngine\nEngine Displacement: 599cc\nEngine Choice:\nHonda CBR600RR\nEngine Intake: Plenum made by rapid prototyping of volume: 1.2 litres\nMaximum\nTorque\n: 66Nm @ 9000rpm\nMaximum\nBhp\n: 78.7W @ 13250rpm\nFuel: RON 95\nSteering\n&\nSuspension\nSuspension Type:\nSLA Double Wishbone\nWheelbase\n: 1832m\nSteering:\nRack & Pinion\ntype\nBrakes\nBrake Type:\nDisc Brake\nBrake Details: Multi-Piston with brake biasing\nCaliper\n: Fixed Caliper Type\nTransmission\nHonda Civic Quaife type Differential\nTorque biasing Limited slip differential with custom built housing\nChain and sprocket based final drive system designed Team Structure\nK-3\nK-3 improved upon its preceding models by leaps and bounds. It was the first car to be powered by a KTM Duke 390 single cylinder engine. Several innovative designs were successfully implemented like data acquisition, digital display and wireless telemetry. K-3 has carbon fiber reinforced parts which include body panels and mufflers. K-3 has its Topology optimized suspension aluminum uprights weighing 950g each. The car boasts of its new 3-D printed ABS plastic intake. The team successfully performed its engine tuning through PowerTronic ECU.\nThe Team participated in Formula Bharat 2017 and were one of the few teams to clear the technical inspection round. The Team stood second in the Business Presentation event during the competition and stood 6th in the Rulebook quiz.\nGeneral\nOverall Length: 2980mm\nCurb weight: 226kgf\nTyre Specifications: Avon A92 20X7.2-13\nWheel Rim Diameter: 13\"\nChassis\nMaterial: Tubular Seamless Carbon Steel\nFrame Weight: 35kgf\nFront Track: 137.0 cm\nRear Track: 131.0 cm\nEngine\nEngine Displacement: 373.2cc\nEngine Choice: KTM 390 DUKE,Single cylinder\nEngine Intake: Plenum made by rapid prot\nMaximum Torque: 33Nm @ 5500rpm\nMaximum Bhp : 33BHP @ 7000rpm\nFuel: RON 95\nSteering & Suspension\nSuspension Type: SLA Double Wishbone\nWheelbase: 1720m\nSteering: Rack & Pinion type\nBrakes\nBrake Type: Disc Brake\nBrake Details: Multi-Piston with brake biasing\nCaliper: Fixed Caliper Type\nTransmission\nClutch type Limited Slip Differential (Drexler).\nChain and sprocket based final drive system designed\nK-4\nIn order to keep up with the fast-paced action and innovations of the FSAE circuit, it is important that we work to better ourselves with every car that is manufactured.\nAn innovative FS car should be sleek, light-weight, fast and efficient. Our latest car K4 checks off all those boxes, considering that it is one of the lightest and fastest cars we have manufactured since inception. It also boasts of several new upgrades that have added a sense of accomplishment to our car.\nPowertrain\nK4 has a 3D printed (chemically welded) side intake which helped us to reduce the overall weight of the car. For the first time, K4 underwent dyno-tuning at a facility in Bengaluru which resulted in better power output and greater fuel efficiency. Eccentric differential mounts were installed which helped in chain tensioning and further reduced the weight.\nChassis\nThe acceleration and performance of the car improved as we successfully reduced the chassis weight by 10 kg as compared to our previous car K3. This was achieved with the proper usage of AISI 4130 mild steel over the AISI 1080 version. Moreover, extensive work into triangulation enabled us to design a smart and efficient structure.\nAerodynamics\nK4 has been made by implementing our Team’s first aerodynamic package element, the under-body diffuser.\nGeneral\nOverall Length: 2830mm\nCurb weight: 251.5kgf\nTyre Specifications: 20.5 x 7.0 - 13 R25B Hoosier\nWheel Rim Diameter: 13\"\nChassis\nMaterial: Tubular Seamless Carbon Steel\nFrame Weight: 35kgf\nFront Track: 130.0 cm\nRear Track: 130.0 cm\nEngine\nEngine Displacement: 373.2cc\nEngine Choice: KTM 390 DUKE,Single cylinder\nEngine Intake: Plenum made by rapid prot\nMaximum Torque: 33Nm @ 5500rpm\nMaximum Bhp : 33BHP @ 7000rpm\nFuel: RON 95\nSteering & Suspension\nSuspension Type: SLA Double Wishbone\nWheelbase: 1580mm\nSteering: Rack & Pinion type\nBrakes\nBrake Type: Disc Brake\nBrake Details: Multi-Piston with brake biasing\nCaliper: Fixed Caliper Type\nTransmission\nClutch type Limited Slip Differential (Drexler).\nChain and sprocket based final drive system designed\nTeam Structure\nTeam KART comprises undergraduate students from 1st to the 5th years.\nTeam at the Silverstone circuit during Formula Student UK 2013\nTeam Mentors\n: 4th & 5th years\nTeam Leader\n: 3rd year\nTeam Managers\n: 3rd year\nSub System Heads\n: 3rd year\nTeam Members\n: 2nd year\nTrainees\n: 1st year\nSubsystems\nSuspension, Steering and Brakes\nChassis\nAerodynamics\nPowertrain\nHigh Voltage Electronics\nLow Voltage Electronics\nData Acquisition\nBattery Management System\nCorporate & Public Relations\nMedia & Web\nCitations\nhttps://www.iitkgp.org/index.php/news/kgp-in-spotlight/1005-team-kart-success-saga-continues-in-the-3rd-consecutive-year\nhttps://www.iitkgp.org/index.php/news/kgp-in-spotlight/552-team-kart-at-formula-student-2010\nhttp://education.oneindia.in/news/2013/06/14/iit-kharagpur-student-team-at-fsae-2013-005403.html\nhttp://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/student-activities/initiatives/\nhttp://www.100marks.in/News/formula-1-racing-car-%E2%80%98kart%E2%80%99-designed-by-iit-kgp-students-ready-to-compete-with-professional-f-1-cars/\nhttp://www.racecar-engineering.com/cars/kharagpur/\nhttp://ashwathicr.blogspot.in/2013/06/iit-kharagpur-student-team-at-fsae-2013.html\nhttp://www.coolage.in/2013/08/08/students-excel-at-international-formula-student/\nExternal links\nwww.teamkart.org\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Team_KART&oldid=238262\n\""

        "content": "Congratulations for making it to IIT Kharagpur. If you are coming here and struggling with thinking of what to bring and what not to bring, this guide can help you. This list has been made from experience of staying in campus for two years and realizing what is important or not. The list is not exhaustive and there may be some changes that you may want to make and that's up to you.\nWhat to bring from home?\n1. Clothes (you can consider bringing a formal shirt and a kurta which may be used depending on your department and activities you are involved in and get a white shirt and black pants if you answer questions in ERP in such a way that you might get NSS)\n2. Umbrella (it might be raining heavily when you reach kharagpur, so better to keep it at hand)\n3. Lab coat (if you have an old one, otherwise you can buy it here, needed only if you are in sections 1-8, having chemistry semester)\n4. Waterproof/water resistant slippers/ sandals (you don't want to go and get them repaired every other week if they can't stand being in water)\n5. Covered shoes (necessary if you are in chemistry semester, some labs require you to wear covered/sports shoes)\n6. Lock and keys\n7. Odomos, anti-insect sprays, HIT, all-out or whatever you need to deal with the multitude of insects in rainy season\n8. Toileteries like soap, shampoo, handwash, soap, detergent, toothpaste, toothbrush, deo, comb, nailcutter etc. (you can buy it from here buy unless you want to go to market straight away, better to carry some)\n9. Things related to your interests (sports gear, musical instruments, kindle, books, etc)\n10. Curtain for a single window (nice to have if you don't like waking up with sun shining on your face)\n11. Food (you'll realize its importance eventually)\n12. Medical kit for common medicines (like painkillers, something for fever or coughs, diarrohea and vomiting, ORS) and band-aids.\n13. Laptop (NOT a necessity but is easier to view slides on laptop than on phone, you can wait till Dusshera holidays to get one)\n14. Clock and calendar (not necessary but its so easy to get used to their presence)\n15. Torch and batteries (for the rare case when electricity isn't available, maybe an hour in a semester?)\n16. Bag for carrying to class\n17. Towels (carry at least 2 for when you need a second one because first one is wet)\n18. Plate, glass tumbler, bowl, spoon, fork and knives (get knife from campus if you travel by air, these things may be helpful when you want to eat in your room or get NSS and have to attend camp in December)\n19. Mobile phone (you may need to frequently check mails for class updates and check Facebook groups for many activities)\n20. Any necessary documents (will be mentioned on front page of ERP, in the sign-in page)\nWhat to buy here?\nSome of these you may get from your home, depending on how far you live from campus.\n1. Mattress (available either in you Halls or Tech market)\n2. Pillow\n3. Bedsheets and pillow covers (if getting them from home, buy the largest single sized ones you can so it is easy to tuck in)\n4. Stationery including notebooks, pens, pencils, erasers, scientific calculator, engineering drawing kit (if you are in physics semester or sections 11-20, more information will be given in first ED class)\n5. Hangers, clotheslines, hanging clips, laundry basket\n6. Bucket, mug and soapcases\n7. Dustbin\n8. Shelves and baskets (not necessary but they make organising your room much easier, you have somewhere to dump stuff if you need your able to be clean)\n9. Multiplugs/spikes/extension boards (it depends on your room if you'll need it, some rooms already have more than enough plugs)\n10. LAN cable (if you bring a laptop)\n11. Blankets (it will not be needed till late October or November, can bring from home in Dusshera hoidays)\n12. Sweatshirts (same condition as blankets, you can buy once cold hits and show off the IIT tag)\n13. Pen stand (you might not need it if you are a person who organises their table)\n14. Bicycle (you may get through without it but you will be one of the rare people if you do. There are buses but usually they are too crowded or may be easy to miss. Unless you want to walk at least 2 km everyday to class, a bicycle may be very helpful)\n15. Water-bottle (its the only reason to always carry a bag)\n16. Wall hooks (you may have someone who will add nails in your room in which case you might not need it)\n17. Sewing kit with a couple of threads, some buttons, safety pins and needles (in case you are snickering, knowing a bit of sewing can really help you at times when you lose a button or get a tear in your clothes)\nWhere can you buy?\nMost Halls of Residences (aka hostels) have shops where you can buy. Some temporary shops may be set up near some Halls.\nAlternatively, you can buy whatever you need from Technology Market (just ask anyone where is it or follow Google Maps), also known as Tech Market or TechM.\nIf you can wait for some time or like buying online then all major e-commerce websites deliver to campus.\nExtra information\nElectric kettle: Some people think that they should have brought it from home but unless you have extra electric kettles lying around, you can always order from Amazon. It is also possible to get through a whole year or more, without ever using your own electric kettle. Some people borrow their wingmates' kettles whenever need be and return them.\nInduction plates: They are not allowed in most Halls although checking differs from Hall to Hall.\nReferences\nThis list was first made by\nPankhuri Saxena (HS '22)\nin her first year and later posted in the group \"IIT Kharagpur Freshers' Official 2018-19\".\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Fresher%27s_Packing_Guide&oldid=89336\n\""

A prominent example of that remains the Windows Store in Windows 8 & 10. They can be set using\nnetsh\n, or network shell, a command-line utility which allows local or remote configuration of network devices such as the interface.\nThe following are some relevant commands (Run\ncmd as an adminisrator\nand type the following) :\n1.\nnetsh winhttp show proxy\n: This command shows the current proxy setting\n2.\nnetsh winhttp reset proxy\n: This command resets the current proxy setting to a direct connection.\n3.\nnetsh winhttp import proxy source=ie\n: This command sets Internet Explorer as the proxy source for\nnetsh\n, thus both sharing the same proxy.\nNote:\nFor some Windows users, the Git Bash accepts the proxy settings as mentioned below for Linux. In the Git Bash command line, input the following proxies:\nhttp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nhttps_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nftp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nLinux\nIn *nix based systems, proxy settings are controlled via environment variables which can be updated in a number of ways. A few of these methods are described below:\nSetting up proxy settings in Ubuntu's Network Manager.\nAutomatic Script\nIf you are on Debian/Ubuntu, use the script provided at the link to set system-wide proxies for mostly used commands instantly.\nhttps://github.com/thealphadollar/set_proxy_kgp\nIf you are on some other Linux distribution, please create an issue at the same repository.\nGUI\nIn most cases, a desktop environment (Unity for example; ships default with Ubuntu) provides a graphical user interface to access network settings under the\nSystem Settings\n>\nNetwork\noption. An option to set up proxies can be found there.\nYou can also use applications like dconf-editor to configure system wide proxy. You can also configure no_proxy settings using this application.\nCommand Line\nCommand line interface provides a quick way of updating your environment variables and thus your proxy settings. The proxy values are contained within the following variables -\nhttp_proxy\n,\nhttps_proxy\n,\nftp_proxy\n,\nsocks_proxy\n,\nno_proxy\n. One can update these values using a sample command shown below:\nexport http_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nThe variable\nno_proxy\ncontains those addresses for which the proxy access is disabled (useful for certain library websites, Moodle website, DC website etc.,). These settings, however, are not persistent through different login sessions and you must put these commands in your\n.bashrc\n(for\nbash\nshell) or\n.zshrc\n(for\nzsh\nshell) to be applied every time on shell startup.\nYou can also permanently export these settings to root environment settings by editing the\n/etc/environment\nfile. Open this file with\nsudo\npermission using your favorite text editor (\nvim\nfor example) and paste the following:\nhttp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nHTTP_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nhttps_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nHTTPS_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nFTP_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nftp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nno_proxy=127.0.0.0/8,::1,10.0.0.0/8\nSave and exit. The environment settings should now be always applied to your current environment. Verify this by checking the output of\nsudo env | grep proxy\n. It is, however, important to note that some applications might require their own proxy to be set up separately (\ngit\n, apt-get,\nwget\nfor example) and you must consult the appropriate man pages. To configure \"apt-get\" to use proxy add the following lines to \"/etc/apt/apt.conf\"\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nIn case you do not add the proxy options to root's environment, use the\n-E\nflag to ask\nsudo\nto preserve the existing environment variables. For example:\nsudo -E add-apt-repository \"deb\nhttp://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/\nsaucy universe multiverse\"\nOS X\nGo to\nSystem Preferences\n>\nNetwork\n>\nSelect the appropriate service on the left (eg. WiFi)\n>\nAdvanced\n>\nProxies\n, and set both HTTP and HTTPS proxies.\nProxy bypass rules can be configured at the bottom.\niOS\nGo to\nSettings > Wi-Fi > Tap on the Wi-Fi network that you've connected to > Scroll down to HTTP Proxy > Set the server and port, and go back to the Wi-Fi screen for the settings to take effect.\nThere is no way to configure proxy bypass rules.\nRaspberry Pi\n1. For apt :\nNavigate to the following folder as follows:\ncd /etc/apt/apt.conf.d\nCreate a file called 10proxy:\nsudo nano 10proxy\nWithout authentication add these line:\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy \"\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\n\";\nWith Authentication add these line :\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"\nhttp://username:\n[email protected]\n:8080\n\";\nAcquire::https::Proxy \"\nhttp://username:\n[email protected]\n:8080\n\";\nAcquire::ftp::Proxy \"\nhttp://username:\n[email protected]\n:8080\n\";\n2. For everything else:\nEdit this file:\nsudo nano /etc/environment\nAdd these line :\nhttp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nHTTP_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nhttps_proxy=\nhttps://172.16.2.30:8080/\nHTTPS_PROXY=\nhttps://172.16.2.30:8080/\nFTP_PROXY=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nftp_proxy=\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080/\nno_proxy=127.0.0.0/8,::1,10.0.0.0/8\nAndroid\nSetting the HTTP proxy for WiFi on Android Lollipop.\nWhen connected to any of the mentioned access points, opening WiFi settings and long pressing the current WiFi network will give a\nModify Network\noption. Within this, scroll down and tick the\nProxy Server\ncheckbox and enter the IP address and port. This will allow you to use browser, play store and some other applications but\nWhatsApp\nand\nSkype\nwill not work.\nHowever, to use wifi for WhatsApp, Skype, messenger and other applications , you can use applications like Drony, Proxifier, Psiphon, DroidVPN etc. These apps are available in Play Store.\nAlso, it is to be noted that applications like Drony and Proxifier are proxy configuring app, they simply tunnel your whole internet traffic through a proxy server, in our case through IIT Kgp's proxy server whereas Psiphon and DroidVPN are VPN apps. The difference is that in former case , your internet requests are handled by IIT kgp's own server whereas in latter case an outside server handles your internet requests. Using internal server provides you privacy since your actual IP is \nAlso, speed wise Drony and Proxifier are better than Psiphon and DroidVPN. But the advantage of VPN apps over others is that you can access sites blocked by IIT Kgp like Torrents etc.\nIf the phone can be or is already rooted, applications like ProxyDroid and AutoProxy Lite may provide better experience. However, if you do not prefer to root your phone, use applications like DroidVPN, Psiphon or SurfEasy to configure proxy settings.\nWindows Phone\nGo to\nSettings > Wifi\nand touch on the required connection. It should give an option to setup the proxy.\nBypass\nThe proxy server does not route connections back inside the local subnet, but silently times out. To connect to a computer inside the KGP network, you need to bypass the proxy for that computer's IP, and make a direct connection. The following is a list of IPs and hostnames for which it is useful to bypass the proxy. An asterisk ( * ) or ( x ) represents any value.\nlocalhost and 127.0.0.1\nAll IPs in KGP's subnet – 10.x.x.x\n*.iitkgp.ernet.in\nIf you want to configure the\nno_proxy\nvariable, set it to\n10.0.0.0/8,127.0.0.0/8,::1\n.\nFor instructions on how to bypass the proxy for your OS or device, see\nSetup\n.\nWorkarounds\nKGP's proxies only allow HTTP connections on ports 80 and 443. This means that several much needed tools are broken behind the Great Fire Proxy. Depending on what you are trying to do, the following workarounds might be useful. These instructions are written with *nix based systems in mind, but equivalent alternatives for Windows can be found (often with same name).\nTor\ntor\nanonymises traffic, and has the useful side effect of convincing the proxy that we're making an HTTP connection.\nAs of September 2015, the institute is actively blocking tor connections, but bridge is not necessary to connect to tor.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\nBrowse the Internet through tor\nIf you only need to access websites through a browser, download the\nTor Browser Bundle\n, which provides a nice and easy to configure GUI setup and is available for Android, Linux, Mac, and Windows.\nSetting up tor in Android\nDownload Orbot from\nF-Droid\nor from\nPlay Store\nand install.\nGo to Settings > Select Outbound Proxy Type and enter HTTPS. Select Outbound Proxy Host and enter 172.16.2.30 Select Outbound Proxy Port and enter 8080.\nSelect 'Select Apps' option and tick those apps along with browsers whose traffic you want to route through tor.\nGo back to main screen and press Start. Swipe from right to left to see connection log. When connected, click on browse and choose a browser.\nTo stop tor press Stop and swipe from left to right and turn off 'Apps VPN Mode'\n(Optionally) download Orfox which is a tor browser for android and also if you want to surf onion websites.\nRun tor as a daemon\nSet up tor to run as a daemon on some port (eg. 9050). You can usually do this by installing tor using your distro's package manager (eg.\napt-get install tor\n).\nIn tor's config file (eg. /etc/tor/torrc), add\nHTTPSProxy <KGP proxy host>:<KGP proxy port>\n.\nTo make sure everything works, clear any existing HTTP or HTTPS proxy settings, and set your SOCKS proxy to use tor (eg. 127.0.0.1:9050). Go to\nhttps://check.torproject.org/\n, it should say that you're using tor.\nUsing tor to make the git protocol and OpenShift applications work (on Linux)\nDownload the\nTor Browser Bundle\nNavigate to the folder\n~/.ssh\nand edit the\nconfig\nfile. (You can create one if you don't have it already)\n$ cd ~/.ssh\n$ vim config\nAdd the following lines to the file to make the git protocol work:\n[\n3\n]\nHost github.com\n    User git\n    ProxyCommand connect -4 -S localhost:9050 $(tor-resolve %h localhost:9050) %p\nNow, run the following command after unzipping the downloaded archive of Tor:\n$ ./start-tor-browser.desktop\nNow, the git protocol should have started working.\nTo check this, you can run:\ngit clone\n[email protected]\n:metakgp/metakgp.git\nNote that for this to work properly, your SSH public key must be added to your GitHub account.\nIf it is not added [visit this guide on GitHub\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/\n]\nThis method can be used to get SSH access to OpenShift RedHat cloud applications as well, by appending to the config file:\nHost appname-domain.rhcloud.com\n    User rhcloud.com\n    ProxyCommand nc -x localhost:9150 %h %p\nReplace appname and domain in the above lines with the appropriate names from the OpenShift dashboard.\nTypically, an app that can be accessed at mentorship-gradescrapers.rhcloud.com has:\nURL: mentorship-gradescrapers.rhcloud.com\nappname: mentorship\ndomain: gradescrapers\nproxychains\nproxychains\ndoes TCP and DNS tunnelling through an HTTP server.\nSet up tor as outlined above.\nIn proxychains's config file (eg. ~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf), configure tor as a socks proxy (eg.\nsocks5 127.0.0.1 9050\n).\nNow, programs that make TCP connections on any port should work when run with proxychains. For example,\nproxychains git clone\ngit://example.com\n.\nProxyCap\nis a proxychains alternative for Windows and Mac.\nssh\nSee also:\nHow to SSH into a server that is outside the campus network\nOption 1 (recommended):\ncorkscrew\ntunnels ssh through an HTTP proxy. You need root access on the destination server for this to work.\nInstall corkscrew and in ~/.ssh/config, add the following line:\nProxyCommand <path to corkscrew> <proxy host> <proxy port> %h %p\n.\nOn the destination server, configure sshd to listen on port 443.\nPass in the\n-p 443\noption when running\nssh\n.\nOption 2: You can use proxychains + tor as outlined above. This will be slower, since the connection is routed through tor. However, it has the advantage of not needing to change the port sshd is listening on.\nssh-socks\nIf you have a remote machine that can listen on port 443 (as outline above), you can run a local socks proxy server on your machine to tunnel traffic through your remote machine. For example,\nssh -D 1080 -p 443 myserver.example.com\nwill start an SSH tunnel on port 1080, now you can use\n127.0.0.1:1080\nas a SOCKS proxy.\nOnline ssh clients\nOnline ssh clients are available to connect to remote server. An advantage of using this is that you do not need any extra softwares/configuration on your local computer or the server. Names of some of the websites are as follows :\nSerfish\n- A free AJAX SSH Client to quickly connect to remote server. (Registration not required)\nShiftedit\n- An online Web-based IDE with remote connection support. (Registration required)\nBanned websites\nOption 1: Use tor as outlined above.\nOption 2 (probably faster speeds): Set up a ssh-socks proxy.\ngit\nOption 1 (recommended): Check if there's an HTTPS version of the repo URL available, and use that if possible.\nOption 2: Use proxychains and tor as outlined above.\nOption 3: Use corkscrew for cloning, pushing, pulling using SSH instead of HTTPS (This avoids the requirement of having to enter username and password each time.)\nHost github.com\n   Hostname ssh.github.com\n   Port 443\n   ProxyCommand corkscrew 172.16.2.30 8080 %h %p\nOption 4: Override ssh settings to force use of port 443 instead of 22 for github.com. Ref:\n[1]\nHost\ngithub.com\nHostname\nssh.github.com\nPort\n443\nUser\ngit\nheroku\nOption 1 (recommended): Running commands on the command line of your heroku instance is not possible. Say you want to apply new migrations on a Ruby on Rails app, then, instead of running:\nheroku run rake db:migrate\nyou can run:\nheroku run:detached rake db:migrate\nThis will run the command (rake db:migrate, in this particular case) on the remote machine, and give another command which can be used to view the logs. The output of this command is similar to:\nRunning `rake db:migrate` detached... up, run.8799\nUse `heroku logs -p run.8799 -a app-name` to view the output.\nOption 2: Use proxychains and tor as outlined above.\nUDP\nHTTP Tunneling is a way of encapsulating UDP packets in HTTPS protocol. Currently the tor network does not support UDP. However, you can use VPNs to tunnel UDP traffic.\nInstall OpenVPN. For windows, there is a convenient GUI app.\nGo to OpenVPN settings and set HTTP proxy\n172.16.2.30:8080\n.\nGet .conf file for an openvpn server. vpngate.net has some free servers, be careful to download TCP conf., and only for servers open on port 443. Paid VPNs with stable connections are also available if you look for them.\nRun OpenVPN GUI as administrator (windows) and add KGP proxy. Load the .conf file you downloaded. This should create a new TUN/TAP device, and internet should now work without a proxy.\nThe connection will be flaky if using vpngate servers. Don't expect to be able to play online games this way, since tunneling would delay your UDP packets too much to get a good ping, even with stable VPN servers.\nsshuttle\nsshuttle\nis more easy and powerful over normal ssh socks tunneling for many reasons :-\nApp don't need to use a socks proxy\nClient don't need to have root access on remote machine\nYou don't want to create an ssh port forward for every single host/port on the remote network.\nIt's very simple to use. sshuttle requires\ncorkscrew\nfor tunneling. Steps :-\n$ git clone\nhttps://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle\nConfigure\ncorkscrew\ninside\n~/.ssh/config\n. A line in the file should be something like\nProxyCommand corkscrew 172.16.2.30 8080 %h 443\nStart sshuttle by navigating inside the cloned directory and running\n./sshuttle --dns -r username@sshserver 0.0.0.0/0 -vv\nRemove all the proxy settings whatsoever from browser, applications, `/etc/environment`, etc. i.e. use Direct Connection.\nsshuttle catches every tcp connection and routes it through the ssh server.\nnvm\nnvm\n(node version manager) is used to download, compile and install node.\nTo set proxy for nvm, use the following commands:\nexport http_proxy=172.16.2.30:8080\nexport https_proxy=172.16.2.30:8080\nexport NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=\nhttps://nodejs.org/dist\nnpm\nnpm\nis a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js\nTo set proxy for npm :-\nnpm config set proxy\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\nnpm config set https-proxy\nhttp://172.16.2.30:8080\nCloud Computing Services\nSeveral cloud computing services and VPS providers are now available for circumvention. Digital Ocean, Amazon EC2, Vultr, Google Compute Engine are some of the popular providers.\nStreisand\nis a convenient one-click solution to create an IPSec secured personal VPN based on the default L2TP/IP protocol. This protocol is supported by default on Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and several other operating systems.\nDigital Ocean\nis a cloud computing service, which provides SSH access to droplets in their data centers. Digital Ocean doesn't have a free plan, but credit of $50 can be obtained by signing up for the\nGitHub Student Developer Pack\n. (All currently enrolled students of the institute are eligible.) Further, Digital Ocean requires a Credit Card to be added as payment method (Credit/Debit card is only take as a payment method. You will not be charged anything on setting up the account, provided you are using student pack), or a $5 remittance\nthrough PayPal to get the account started.\nOnce the account can create droplets, droplets may be used for things such as SOCKS proxies, torrenting content through Command Line torrent clients (such as\ntorrent\n), or as an OpenVPN\nserver.\nHistory\nBefore the load balancer proxy was introduced, several proxies could be configured. These proxies had different speeds and availabilities at different times. Some of the older proxies were:\n144.16.192.247\n144.16.192.245\n144.16.192.217\n144.16.192.218\n10.3.100.209\n10.3.100.210\n10.3.100.211\n10.3.100.212\nIn 2014, students were instructed to use a single load balancer proxy.\n[\n4\n]\nThe other proxies no longer work.\nPublic IPs\nThe outside world sees one of the following IPs as your IP when you make any network request. This public IP is converted to an internal IP (which is what you see as your machine's IP) by the proxy server using\nNAT\n. You may need to whitelist these IPs if setting up an external web service that is frequently accessed from campus.\n203.110.246.22 (as of 11 August 2015)\n203.110.246.23 (as of 2 September 2015)\n203.110.243.23 (as of 12 August 2015)\n203.110.242.20 (as of 7 September 2017)\n203.110.242.7  (as of 25 April 2018)\nYou can see your current public IP at\nhttp://www.whatsmyip.org/\n.\nIt is important to know this because any activity done by you gets logged with these IPs and corresponds to the name of the institution. For example, if you make an anonymous edit to Wikipedia, it will be logged under these public IPs, and hence any disruptive behavior by single person might lead to an IP ban and unavailability of resources for everyone inside the campus. It's advisable to create an account for such activities wherever possible, or use one of the workarounds suggested in initial sections.\nSee Also\nInternet and LAN\nHow to SSH into a server that is outside the campus network\nHiT Hi FiT Hai\nDC\nExternal Links\nSet up apt-get to use a http-proxy\nnpm proxy setting\nTop free VPNs\nReferences\n↑\nVerified\nby\nCic\non September 9, 2015.\n↑\nVerified\nby\nrandomkgp\non October 15, 2017.\n↑\nVerified\nby\nIcyflame\non 2015-09-25.\n↑\n\"TSG Facebook post instructing students to use the load balancer proxy\"\n.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Institute_proxies&oldid=146458\n\""

        "title": "How to write SOP",
        "content": "Statement of Purpose\nis one of the critical components of a graduate school application. The purpose of the statement of purpose is many fold, and serves as an important first pitch of your capabilites and interest in your field. In many cases, acceptances or rejections or directly offered without interview after screening of student credentials. In such cases, making a lasting impact and communicating your research, through your statement of purpose, become even more important.\nPurpose\nIt’s misleading that the personal statement is called a \"personal\" statement, since what admission committees are really looking for is a research statement. What admission committees want is a statement about what research you have done, what research you hope to do, and why you like research. (\nSource\n)\nThe purpose of the statement of purpose is:\ndetailed discussion of why the candidate chose the particular program\nwhat he/she intends to do while pursuing the program\nwhat he/she will do after having gained the education\nWhat it's not:\nA detailed curriculum vitae\nA boastful description of what you have achieved in your life\nMasters vs PhD\nApplication to both of the program require writing statement of purpose or\na variant of the essay. However, the standards for the essay are different for\na master's versus a doctoral program; not that one is superior over the other.\nFocus\nExperience\nPrompts\nThis section is empty.\nYou can help by\nadding to it\n.\nKey ideas of SOP\nShow, don't tell. Reinforce every claim you make with supporting evidence from your own experiences. Demonstrate evidence of critical thinking, and discussion of prior relevant research or project experience.\nI personally would like to hear about the difficult aspects of some project you worked on. Tell me how you displayed excellent problem solving skills, were a leader, or showed initiative. Especially if you have done research before, tell me about that research experience, and what you learned from it.\nSource\nMotivation is great. Don't just list out your research projects as successive bullet points. What motivated you to undertake those projects? What did you learn from those projects that motivated you to further pursue research? Why do you want to pursue a Ph.D.?\nTransitions are important. Don't just have sentences mash up against one another without any connective tissue.\nIndicate the names of the faculty you would like to work with. Also, it's a good idea to indicate more than one name otherwise you may risk being pigeonholed.\nIf you send supplemental information, make sure it is directly relevant to the pursuit of graduate study in your field of interest.\nEnsure that your SOP shows that your interests align with the program.\nBasic template\nFirst paragraph: Describe the general areas of research that interest you and why. (This is helpful for a committee to determine which professors should read your application.)\nSecond paragraph, Third, and Fourth paragraphs: Describe some research projects that you worked on. What was the problem you were trying to solve? Why was it important? What approaches did you try?  What did you learn? It’s fine to say that you were unable to fully solve your problem.\nFifth  paragraph: Tell us why you feel you need a Ph.D. Look back to second paragraph and explain what in there appealed to you.\nSixth paragraph: Tell us why you want to come to the university. Whom might you like to work with? What papers have you looked at from the university that you enjoyed reading? Why is this university the right place for you?\nWriting the SOP\nCollecting information\nAsk yourself the following questions and prepare a document containing your\nresponses:\nWhat are the outstanding problems or current trends in your favorite field?\nWhich fields hold the most promise for the future?\nWhy are you specifically well suited for this area of research?\nWhat do you enjoy doing – or, more accurately, what could you see yourself doing day-in and day-out until you’re 30?\nWhat do you want to learn?\nThese questions will provide a structure to your statement of purpose and help\nyou prepare your draft efficiently. At the same time, these questions will also\nhelp you evaluate and reinforce your plans of pursuing a graduate degree.\nPreparing first draft\nOnce you have a story from the previous section, it is time to prepare an\noutline\n. Preparing effective outline is a key step, much like having a table\nof contents or structure when writing a thesis.\nDoing revisions\nIt is important to get your essay reviewed by as many people as possible.\nGrammatical errors, sentence flaws and spelling mistakes are frowned upon in\na statement of purpose, specially since it is meant to reflect your best\npossible effort towards getting into the school. It is very easy to overlook\nsuch mistakes in a single round of revision.\nIt is recommended to have your essay reviewed by at least\none professor,\na graduate student, and a classmate or colleague.\nHowever, note that\ndifferent people have different opinions about how you should you story, hence\nyou may get conflicting suggestions. Nonetheless, it is better to have several\nperspectives than dwell in ignorance.\nDo's and Dont's\nThis section is empty.\nYou can help by\nadding to it\n.\nChecklist\nCheck if your statement of purpose contains answers to the following questions:\n[ ] Why you want to be a graduate student?\n[ ] Why you would make a good graduate student (with supporting evidence from the facts of your life)?\n[ ] What would it be like to have you here?\n[ ] Are you repeating the details already present in your resume?\n[ ] What kind of research could you see yourself doing and why?\n[ ] Does it show interest, experience, and potential?\n[ ] Is there proper match between your area of interest and the faculty names you have indicated?\n[ ] Does your statement indicate how you'd\ncontribute\nto the program and not just benefit from it?\nReferences\nExternal Links\nsop for Mba\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_write_SOP&oldid=96657\n\""

        "title": "Fresher's guide",
        "content": "Welcome to IIT Kharagpur! Here's some friendly advice on how to get settled in quickly and comfortably.\nRegistration\nThe registration process in previous years required physical presence of the student on registration days, resulting in long queues for fee payment and verification. With the integration of an online payment gateway with the\nERP\n, fee payment and the registration process can now be completed online and there are no more queues.\nRegistration is defined as formal enrollment in the academic subjects of the semester. Only after registration does the name of the student appear in the list of students of the subject instructor. It is enabled after the fee payment process is completed.\nAdditional subjects and\nmicro-specialization\nmust be indicated during\nregistration\nprocess. Freshers can ignore this section as the semester subjects are fixed in the first year.\nAfter the registration is submitted, it will be digitally signed by your\nfaculty advisor\n. This is indicated in the\nStudent Academic Activities (UG)\nsection in\nERP\non the right-hand corner of the screen. Once this is done, a duly signed printout of this sheet must be submitted to the faculty advisor before the dates given in the timeline. This formally completes the registration process.\nRegistration must be completed within 10 days of commencement of classes.\nPacking Guide\nIf you are confused about packing and what can you bring, a list has been created\nhere\n. The list has many items that you may be using during your stay.\nSmart card and medical booklet\nThe smart card of a student is the formal proof of studentship at IIT Kharagpur (can be used as a photo identity proof) and also serves as the library card when issuing books from the\nlibrary\n. It will be issued to all the students shortly after they are admitted and the document verification (12th Marksheet, JEE Admit Card etc.,) is completed.\nIn case of loss of the\nsmart card\n, an\nFIR\nmust be lodged at the nearest police station, and there is a re-issuance fee of Rs. 1000/- for lost card. A copy of the FIR is required for re-issuance of a lost smart card.\nTo avail of medical facilities from\nBC Roy Technology Hospital\n, a medical card is required. This card is issued through the halls of residence. It requires a passport size photograph pasted on the top, and the card must be signed and stamped by the\nwarden\nof that hall. The card must be presented while seeking appointment and consulting doctors and collecting medicines from the\npharmacy\nat\nthe hospital\n.\nWiFi and LAN\nSee also:\nInstitute Proxies\nand\nDC\nIIT Kharagpur has an extensive network of WiFi routers throughout the campus and halls of residence. Connecting to the WiFi routers require a password to connect to the secured SSID WiFi. The password can be set individually by students on their ERP. There are multiple WiFi access points like Campus, Academic, Student, Guest etc and any network could be connected to.\nThe LAN network has\nDHCP\nSupport, so\nIPs\nare dynamically allocated to a connected device upon connection, no static configuration is required. After successful proxy configuration, the Internet can be accessed.\nNote that connecting to the DC network through WiFi is banned, so LAN must be used to download and share content locally.\nOneDrive: Cloud Storage\nIIT Kharagpur students are allotted 100GB of cloud storage in one drive, one can access it by signing up\nhere\nusing your Institute email address,\nNote that this email is only available as long as your institute email address is activated (till graduation.).\nImportant facebook pages/groups\nAwaaz\n-\nAwaaz\nis the hindi campus media body.\nScholars' Avenue\n-\nThe Scholars' Avenue\nis english campus media body.\nDirector IIT Kharagpur\n- It is the official page of Director, IIT Kharagpur\nTechnology Students' Gymkhana\n- Technology Students' Gymkhana is the hub of the numerous extra-curricular and co-curricular activities in IIT Kharagpur ranging from sports to socio-cultural.\nclickkgp\n-it is for photographs of events happen in campus\nBranding and Relations Cell\n-\nSearch for your fresher's group and make sure to join it. It will be something like \"IIT Kharagpur freshers 20XX\"\nIf you don't have a Facebook account or want to see updates from all these pages at one place you can use\nNaarad\n.\nMobile phone\nAirtel and Vodafone seem to be the most preferred networks on campus. During admission time, most of the stores offer SIM cards but it is recommended that the student and their parents go through the various plans and data packs available in West Bengal Circle (note that this is different from the Kolkata telecom circle) from the respective cellular network website so they can make an informed decision and are aware of the various benefits of each one.\nFor residential address proof, the student must get a proof of address letter signed by the hall warden, the format of the letter is available from the respective hall office. This is required as a local address proof.\nUsage policy\nLectures\nPolicies around using mobile phones in classrooms are set by the course instructor. Generally, mobile phones are permissible in lecture halls during regular classes, provided they are in silent mode. Using mobile phones as in browsing or gaming during lectures is frowned upon and will attract the wrath of the instructor and may lead to expulsion from the lecture hall. Restrictions regarding the usage of mobile phones inside the lecture hall will generally be clarified by the instructor along with other course-related information in the first lecture of every course. The instructor's policy is final and binding in this regard.\nExamination\nDuring semester examinations, mobile phones are strictly banned and if brought into the examination hall, must be handed over to the invigilators at the beginning of the examination and collected afterward. Use of mobiles during examinations is considered\nUnfair Means\nand will lead to disciplinary action by the\nDisciplinary Committee\n.\nThere have been some cases in the past in which students mistakenly kept mobile with them and later on the invigilators found out and then the student was de-registered from the subject. So, remember not to keep the phone with you in exams.\nHall and roommates\nFrom 2014 onward, first year students have been exclusively allotted to a single hall of residence. In 2014 and 2015, male students were allotted\nLal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence\nwhile female students were allotted\nMother Teresa Hall of Residence\n. In 2015, however, girls were allotted\nSarojini Naidu / Indira Gandhi Hall of Residence\n.\nSince LBS has triple occupancy rooms, all first years had to register in groups of three for one room. Though in 2015 the students were allotted rooms with their own department mates.\nHowever, from 2016, the room allocation was reverted to allocating rooms in different halls, with the majority of male students (around 700) being alloted\nLal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence\nwhile the remaining male students were distributed to other halls. The same pattern of hall allotment followed in 2017 as well.\nAs of 2018-19, undergraduate girls are in allocated one of the following Halls: Sarojini Naidu/Indira Gandhi Hall of Residence, Mother Teresa Hall of Residence and Sister Nivedita Hall of Residence. Boys are alloted one of the following in their first year: Lal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence, Madan Mohan malviya Hall of Residence, Rajendra Prasad Hall of Residence, Radhakrishnan Hall of Residence, Azad Hall of Residence, Patel Hall of Residence and Nehru Hall of Residence.\nAs of 2025, first year undergraduate girls are allocated in Sister Nivedita Hall of Residence (SNVH/IGH), and boys are alloted Lal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence.\nBicycle and other useful things\nBicycle stalls are put up around the\nTech Market\narea from where they can be bought easily. The sellers bargain after the parents leave and the dust settles, so make the most out of it. There will be a variety of cycles ranging from Rs. 3500 to Rs. 6000. There is not much need to buy a higher end bicycle with gears and stuff. You can also get a used bicycle from\nTech Market\nor from Cycle Shed owners with price ranging from Rs. 1300 to Rs. 2500. The bicycles with thin tires are easy to maintain, cheaper and easier to ride. Since campus has excellent roads, so there is no need to purchase bicycle with shockers and shock absorbers. One of the best bicycle to purchase is Btwin My Bike White, however, you can only get it from Decathlon Stores or online purchase from decathlon.in or other online retailers like Snapdeal and Amazon. The price of the bike is around Rs. 4,500, the bike has excellent build quality and comes with a lifetime warranty. There are abundant cycle sheds in every hall and cheap cycle repairing shops in every hall.\nOne more thing to note is 'Simpler the design of cycle, the better it is'.\nThe bed and pillow will also be available at the\nTech Market\n. You can also find some temporary shops near MMM hall for beds and all There are a variety of beds ranging from the synthetic one to the wool ones. Though it would be advisable to bring bed and pillow sheets from home. You can also buy hangers, hanging clips, and hanging strings from the\nTech Market\n. Though unfortunately, some items like clothes and sports equipment aren't that up to the mark so its advisable to bring it from home. Other consumables like toothpaste, soap, etc of all recognized brands are available. There is a Big Bazaar outlet and also\nGole Bazaar\nfor an even wider variety of options.\nMess and food\nThe mess serves 4 meals i.e. breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner. Breakfast and snacks are the nice meals and it would be advisable not to miss those. For dinner, there are a lot of canteens available and some hotels too. A list of all the eateries can be found \n. Delivery is available, although students MUST go to the front gate of their hall, as vendors are not allowed inside the blocks in any of the Halls of Residences. Although it won't be wise for students to form a preconceived notion regarding mess food and should try them out for sure.\nAcademics and classes\nSee also:\nHow to get deregistered\nand\nCentral Library\nFirst year lecture classes are held in\nVikramshila\ncomplex,\nNalanda\ncomplex and a few in the\nMain Building\n. Academics have a high amount of weightage so it would be advisable to take it seriously. There is a CGPA criteria for a lot of things in campus.\nQuestion Papers\nYou can find previous year question papers here:\nhttps://qp.metakgp.org/\nFor resources, check out:\nhttps://swgiitkgp.org/resources\n, KGPellence Mobile App\nFor Mechanical engineering students ONLY, visit\nhttp://mech14.weebly.com/\nfor course materials and books.\nDouble Major\nSee also:\nDepartment change\nand\nDouble Major\nSince session 2024-25, the provision of\nDouble Major\nhas been introduced. This replaced the previous provision of\nDepartment Change\n.\nUG Curriculum\nThe curriculum for admission batch 2024 and later can be found\nhere\n.\nClubs and societies\nClubs and Societies\nform an integral part of the life at IIT Kharagpur. They usually held their interviews in the beginning of the semester except for a few. The posters for the interviews would be put up on the mess and around the hall. The intro seminars for the same are also held to give an idea of what the society does.\nSocieties and Clubs\nallow you to explore your interests and if you don't find any to suit your interest, you can open a new one yourself by contacting the\nTechnology Students' Gymkhana\n.\nTechnical Activities\nSee also:\nList of student run research groups\nand\nTechnology Robotix Society § Activities\nIIT Kharagpur provides students ample opportunities to engage in technical activities. Students can join a\nstudent run research group\n, selection for these organizations usually happen in the spring semester. You can also approach a professor asking them for a project in their area of interest. You can search professors by their area of interest using\nMCMP\n. You can find when a particular professor is free by using\nWIMP\n. Students can also participate in various workshops, hackathons and contests held throughout the year.\nSports and Games\nSee also:\nInter IIT Sports Meet\nHealth and Hospital\nSee also:\nBC Roy Technology Hospital\n,\nGym\n,\nSwimming Pool\nand\nHow to claim your medical expenses\nE-commerce and courier\nSee also:\nCourier services in the campus\nAll the major E-commerce companies and courier services deliver your order inside the campus. However they are not allowed inside the hall premises and you must collect it from your hall gate or a nearby location. Usually the delivery-guy waits in case till evening at various parts of the campus.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Fresher%27s_guide&oldid=239494\n\""
