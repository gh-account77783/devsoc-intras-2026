        "content": "Google Summer of Code\nGoogle Summer of Code Logo\nFounded\n2005\nBegins\nApril – May\nEnds\nAugust - October\nWebsite\nhttps://summerofcode.withgoogle.com\nThe\nGoogle Summer of Code\n(\nGSoC\n) is an international online program focused on bringing new contributors into\nopen source software development\n. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a programming project under the guidance of mentors. Stipends of upto\nUS$3,000\n(as of 2023) are awarded to students who successfully complete a proposed free and open-source software development project during the summer. Google has introduced multiple sized projects (\n90\n,\n175\nand\n350\nhours). As of 2024 the standard project length for small (\n90\nhour) projects is\n8 weeks\n, while medium (\n175\nhour) and large (\n350\nhour) projects are\n12 weeks\nby default\nHistory\nThe event draws its name from the 1967\nSummer of Love\n(of the 1960s\nCounterculture\n), and the idea for the SoC came directly from Google's founders,\nSergey Brin\nand\nLarry Page\n.\n[\n1\n]\nFrom 2007 until 2009 Leslie Hawthorn, who has been involved in the project since 2006, was the program manager.\n[\n2\n]\nIn 2010, Carol Smith took over management of the program.\n[\n3\n]\nDuring the the period of 2005-2012 IIT Kharagpur had produced the highest number (51) of GSoCers from India\n[\n4\n]\n, and by 2016 there have been 92 GSoCers from IIT Kharagpur\n[\n5\n]\n.  But as of now,\nIIIT Hyderabad\nholds the record for producing maximum number of GSoC students from India.\n[\n6\n]\nApplication\nTo apply in Google Summer of Code, students need to write an application proposal to their respective mentoring organisations. Often mentoring organisations have their own application templates which typically asks the student to give biographical information, details of the project and a timeline. The application window typically opens up in March for a period of eleven days but it is recommended that students start working on their applications as soon as the list of participating organisations is announced.\nEligibility\nTo participate in GSoC one needs to be a student and should be more than 18 years old before the results are announced. There is no other requirement of department or year of study.\n[\n7\n]\nAlso, you cannot participate in Google Summer of Code for more than\ntwo\ntimes. This criteria is in application since 2017 edition.\nPost 2021, even non-university students can participate in GsoC.\nStipend\nUntil 2016, Google paid a total amount of US $5,500 in three batches. The initial amount of US $500 was paid at the end of the community bonding period, the second instalment of US $2,250 at the end of the mid-term evaluation, and the remaining amount at the end of the final-term evaluation. However, from 2017, Stipends are adjusted based on country ($2,400 for India) and are paid in three parts, one after each successful evaluation.\n[\n8\n]\n. This was later changed to 3000# for India in 2019 edition.\nFirst Evaluation (paid Late June / early July): 30%\nSecond Evaluation (paid Late July / early August): 30%\nFinal Evaluation (paid September): 40%\nGoogle offers payment through Payoneer in two modes, but for Indian students only direct deposit option is available. No money is given should one fail the evaluations, miss the deadlines or withdraw from the program.\nAs of 2024, Indian students get a stipend of $750 (for small sized projects), $1500 (for medium sized projects) or $3000 (for large sized projects) in two stages:\nMid Evaluation: (Mid July) - 45%\nEnd Evaluation (Early September) - 55%\nHighlights\nResources\nFLOSS Manuals\nhas a detailed manual about Google Summer of Code which includes sample student proposals.\nPython Software Foundation's FAQs on GSoC\nare also pretty informative.\nList of students\nThis list is\nincomplete\n; you can help by\nexpanding it\n.\nYear\nName (Batch)\nOrganization\nProject\n2009\nRaviteja Dodda\nOMII-UK\nGenerating Customized User Interfaces to the Cloud focusing on the requirement of the end-user\n2010\nAnurag Priyam (ME '13 )\nNESCent\nDevelop an API for NeXML I/O, and, RDF triples for BioRuby\n2010\nChidambaram Annamalai\nR Project for Statistical Computing\nrdx -

        "title": "Technology Environment Society",
        "content": "1 About us\nTechnology Environment Society (TES) is a student-led organization at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. TES is dedicated to the conservation and preservation of the environment, and to promoting sustainability in society. Its members are committed to raising awareness about ecology, nature, and the environment, and to sensitizing others to the importance of protecting our planet. Through a range of initiatives and activities, TES strives towards more sustainable future by finding solutions to environmental challenges and promoting conservation efforts within the campus and the wider community.\n2 Vision\nTES aims to enhance and preserve the socio-ecological space within the IIT Kharagpur campus, with a focus on sustainability and community welfare.\n3 History\n3.1 Vision Prabaho\nAlthough TES was officially institutionalized as a part of Gymkhana in 2021, its roots date back to 2018 when it was founded as Vision Prabaho by Biswarup Mondal, Sirsendu Sekhar Barman and Pragnaditya Malakar, who formed a team with other enthusiastic members. Vision Prabaho, the mother organization, is now registered as an NGO run by IIT Kharagpur alumni and other like-minded individuals. Our journey began when we met Mr. Tarak Chandra Paul, an environmentalist with an exceptional passion for green initiatives. We invited him to our IIT Kharagpur campus and organized awareness programs that received an overwhelming response from students, faculty, and campus residents. This enthusiasm motivated us to consider how we could contribute to building a better future. The team then embarked on various projects, campaigns, and initiatives to address environmental issues. We recognized the need to bring all stakeholders together under one umbrella for this common goal. The team was bolstered by the support of Prof. P. P. Chakraborty (Former Director, IIT Kharagpur), Prof. W. Mohanty (Gymkhana president), Prof. P. Patnaik, Late B.B. Rai (Senior Engg Horticulture section), and many other faculty members during our initial phases. Furthermore, the unwavering support from Ms. B. Chakraborty, Ms. A. Patnaik, and other campus residents tremendously helped us shape our idea.\n3.2 Incorporation as a Gymkhana society\nFinally, TES was formalized as a full-fledged Gymkhana society in November 2021. Since then, it has grown steadily and is perhaps the first student organization in IIT dedicated to environmental issues. TES now has over 30 student members, including undergraduate, postgraduate, and research scholars.\n4 Leadership\n4.1 Founders\nBiswarup Mondal, Dr. Sirsendu Sekhar Barman and Dr. Pragnaditya Malakar\n4.2 First governing members\nDr. Bijan Kumar Das, Dr. Saptarshi Lahiri, Dr. Atanuka Paul, Dr. Koushik Haldar, Anjan Sarkar, Dr. Prerona Das, Varisha Farheen, Dr. Tuhin Chakraborty, Victor Avisek Chatterjee, Sovan Lal Banerjee, Dr. Jeet Majumdar, Shibayan Kayal, Dr. Raj Poddar, Tanumoy Mondal, Dr. Urmi Ghosh, Soumya Sandhukhan\n4.3 Current leadership\nAcademic session 2022-2023\nGovernors:\n Rupashree Saha (Research scholar, Geology)  Subhadip Sarkar (Research scholar, CORAL)  Snehangsu Mishra (Research scholar, Energy)  Samik Mukhapadhay (UG, Civil Engg)\nHeads & Members:\nSreya Sengupta, Ankit Dipta Dutta, Priyantan Gupta, Puja Dey, Ankit Senapati, Alice Tongbram, Nitesh Jha, Ayushi Dhar, Atreyee Dey, Rishav Sahoo, Amit Mondal, Srinivasarao M, Hema Jha, Somya Ranjan Dass , Singhmar Harbaksh Singh, Utsav Kyada, Sumit kumar, Bhupesh Verma, Abhishek Singh Maurya, Ravi Katariya, Rajvardhan Singh Jadon, Komal Arya, Tanmay Ekade, Koushal Mujalde, Vinit Mujalda, Ajinkya, A Hasitha, Rishitha Merugu, Golla Meghanandh Manvith Prabhash, K Venkata Gnaneswar, Akash Kumar, Nithya Reddy Vedium\nProfessor in-charge:\n Prof. Manjira Sinha\n Prof. Subha Verma\n4.4 Past leadership\nAcademic session 2021-2022\nGovernors:\n Biswarup Mondal (Research scholar, Chemical Engg),  Atanuka Paul (Research scholar, Chemistry)\nProject heads & Members:\nSoumya Sandhukhan, Rupashree Saha, Sreya Sengupta, Urmi Ghosh, Subhadip Sarkar, Nilanjan Mondal, Snehangshu Mishra, Priyantan Gupta, Puja Dey, Nikitasha Chatterjee, Soumya Sarathi Ganguly, Oindrila Nath, Ankit Senapati, Atreyee Dey\nProfessor in-charge:\n Prof. Manjira Sinha\n Prof. Subha Verma\n5 Functioning\n5.1 Selection procedure\nThe membership in the TES will be issued in the autumn semester (July-December).

It provides a platform for like-minded individuals who yearn to enrich their knowledge of business and apply their skills in various competitions like case studies and hackathons at the national and international levels. A family of around 70 student members, actively working under 3 wings:\nStrategy, Finance, and Analytics\n, BClub is constantly striving to bridge the gap between business and technology.\nHistory\nFounding\nBusiness Club was founded in 2009 as\nGenese-de-Strategie\nby Shailesh Gupta, Harsh Gupta, Srichandana Sanjeev, Sudipto Sannigrahi, and Mayank Mundra. Genesie-de-Strategie was started with a primary objective to educate the students about the world of business strategies. The founders felt a need for students to be informed about the working of the business world for their growth. Over the course of a year, they realised the need to have a more wholesome approach to the world of business. They formed the Business Club in 2010 with a broader perspective toward business.\nGrowth\nIndian Case Challenge,\nIndia’s largest case competition, is the flagship event of the Business Club. ICC now witnesses international participation as well.\nAffiliation to Technology Students’ Gymkhana\n(during the academic session 2014-15) brought official recognition to the club.\nThe Business Club has started to reach out to the entire student population of the college by conducting\nOpen House Sessions\nfor their benefit.\nRegular\nsocial media content\nand\nblogs\nin the domain of finance, strategy and analytics are uploaded on all major social media platforms to keep readers updated.\nFunctioning\nSelections\nSelections to the Business Club are held at the beginning of the first and the second academic year.\nFirst-year selections\nThe selection procedure consists of a\ngroup-discussion\nround followed by a personal\ninterview\nfor the shortlisted candidates. Prospective members aren’t judged based on their business acumen, but on their ability to think clearly, present thoughts in a concise and structured manner, their dedication, and their zeal to learn.\nSecond-year selections\nA training period called the\nsummer program\nis conducted for the students selected in the second academic year to level their knowledge with the students selected in the first year. During this time, they are provided with the same resources to learn everything necessary.\nAfter the summer program, every associate is evaluated on the same knowledge level and a final personal interview is conducted to select the students with the highest knowledge in the three domains. Other soft skills like communication are also kept in mind. Selected students are then assigned the position of sub-heads.\nStructure\nBusiness Club has a four-level organisational structure.\nAdvisors\nconsist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the club.\nThe executive body comprises of\nGovernors\nand\nHeads\nwho are in the third year of their study. They are responsible for heading various wings of the club and its management.\nThe team of\nSub-heads\nis responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the club and the execution of its plans. It consists of students in the second year of their studies.\nAssociates\nare the first years who have a passion to win and are generally business-oriented. These members are oriented towards gaining as much knowledge as they can from the pool of knowledge available to the seniors.\nThe functional structure of the Business Club consists of three wings –\nfinance, analytics, and strategy\n. These wings include all that happens within the world of business.\nActivities\nIntra-Club activities\nTo prepare the associates for the sub-head tenure, they are encouraged to participate in various activities to lay a strong foundation in the three domains of Analytics, Finance, and Strategy. These activities include:\nIntra-club case study Competition\n- The associate batch is divided into small groups and each team is allotted a sub-head as a mentor, who guides the associate batch in solving the problem statement. On the D-day, the executive batch judges the teams through their presentations, and valuable inputs are given.\nKnowledge meets\n- Organising knowledge meetings is the way by which knowledge dissipation happens in the Club. These meetings are conducted by Club members, where they meet and brainstorm on various topics of interest. A strong network consisting of resourceful seniors and mentor professors clarifies any doubts the members may have and make the meetings fruitful.\nWhitepaper -\nThis event is organized so that the associates could choose and research the topic of their choice in the domain of the three wings of the B-club. During the event, Associates put around 20 days of research and at the end present their papers in front of the executive and sub-head Batch, where they give useful insights into the topic\nDrafting modules and blogs -\nClub members design modules and blogs in the three wings. These modules are released through the public handle.\nSummer program\nDuring the Summer holidays, many first-years apart from the Associate Batch are selected for the program as Summer Associates.\nCase study competition\n- This is the second intra-club case study competition. This time associates are made to solve the problem statement on their own without the mentorship of seniors, considering they have already done the courses in the three domains.\nAnalytics competition\n- This competition concentrates on the core of machine learning. Associates are given a data set and this competition demands writing algorithms without using built-in libraries and maximizing the accuracy score on the given dataset.\nTrading Competition -\nDuring this competition Associates and Summer Associates create a mock trading account. This competition lasts for 10 days and associates carry out intraday trading based on the technical and fundamental analysis they have learned in the program.\nAt the end of the summer program, based on the performance and participation in the summer program, associates are selected to be the part of sub-head batch.\nEvents organized by the Club\nThe club conducts a wide range of activities such as open house sessions and case studies enabling students to develop their business acumen by applying their skills and finding solutions to real-world problem statements.\nIndian Case Challenge\nEver since its inception in 2012, the Indian Case Challenge provides the best platform for undergraduate and graduate students from all over India to compete against each other and prove their business and entrepreneurial mettle in a real-life business case scenario. Not only are the participants expected to have strong business skills and financial understanding, but also a feeling for entrepreneurship and a sense of realizing market opportunities.\nICC 2021, organized in association with Kshitij, was a huge success and received a whopping 3200+ unique registrations, including international participation.\nOpen House Sessions\nBusiness Club strives to impart basic knowledge regarding the various facets of business, in an attempt to make the students of IIT Kharagpur more equipped to thrive in the ever-evolving global industry. Open house sessions on basic finance, analytics, and strategy that are conducted in conjunction with organizations such as Alphabeta, ZS Associates, and IIMC Consulting Club have gone a long way towards this.\nWebinars\nInformative webinars, presided by renowned speakers who excel in their respective business fields, are conducted by the club, to enrich the knowledge of the students even in online mode.\nGovernors and Heads\n2014-15\nGovernors\nSarthak Badjatiya\nShramajit Gupta\nVirendra Singh\nHeads\nAnalytics: Pranay Yadav\nConsultancy: Pratyush Devliyal\nFinance: Umang Mavani\nTechnical: Ravikiran Shinde\n2015-16\nGovernors\nAshutosh Dwivedi\nNishant Jayaswal\nShiladitya Saha\nHeads\nAnalytics: Raunak Chitlangia, Shubhrit Agrawal\nConsultancy: Manik Aggarwal\nFinance: Dhruva Ratanpura\nTechnical: Murtaza Phalasiya, Rajat Bhavnani\nLogistics: Rihen Chheda, Ritwik Bajaj\n2016-17\nGovernors\nPriya Mehta\nKumar Sparsh\nUdit Sarin\nHeads\nAnalytics: Charu Agarwal, Shwetha Krishnamurthy\nFinance: Debjyoti Chakrabarti\nConsultancy: Medha Asija\nTechnical: Shubham Singhal, Vaibhav Chauhan\n2017-18\nGovernors\nHarsh Agarwal\nHitendra Pratap\nShubhra Agrawal\nHeads\nAnalytics: Ankit Agarwal, Subham Rajgaria\nFinance: Ankit Agarwal, Rajat Ragha, Shubham Sharma\nStrategy: Shubham Maheshwari\nBlogs and Articles: Rahul Raj\nDesign: Anjali Bharti\n2018-19\nGovernors\nAman Sharma\nNikita Kishore\nHeads\nAnalytics: Yash Jain\nFinance: Amandeep Singh, Puneet Pansari\nStrategy: Amit Gunjan, Yogshree Choukse\n2019-20\nGovernors\nAditya Parashar\nDeepankar Sachdeva\nHeads\nAnalytics: Amrit Goswami, Chinmay Singh, Karan Mahajan\nFinance: Shreyansh Jain, Vikrant Gupta\nStrategy: Tushar Mohandas, Tushar Singla\nTechnical: Aditya Singhania\n2020-21\nGovernors\nAryan Saxena\nLakshraj Doshi\nShashank Singh\nHeads\nAnalytics: Arusarka Bose, Naman Paharia, Abhinav Bohra\nFinance: Sayantan Das, Lakshiyata Chhajer, Amur Khandelwal\nStrategy: Shivam, Gaurav Joshi, Inakshi Kar\n2021-22\nGovernors\nArya Uttamchandani\nSankalp Bose\nHeads\nAnalytics: Karan Uppal, Dikshant Pratap Singh\nFinance: Arnav Bhutda, Suhas Jain, Aditya Saha\nStrategy: Tejaswi Pagadala, Kashish Lundia\nWeb: Piyush Dhamane\nBranding and Public Relations: Deepansh Agrawal\n2022-2023\nGovernors\nMadiha Hanifa\nBharat Uday\nHeads\nAnalytics: Vaibhav Jalani\nStrategy: Siddharth Madupathi, Pragya Choudhary\nFinance: Ram Sundaram, Patel Yuti\nWeb and Design: Sai Kalyan Meghavath\n2023-2024\nGovernors\nSiddharth Dikshit\nShreeya Mishra\nHeads\nAnalytics: Adyan Rizvi, Ishan Ray, Lokesh Tirthani\nFinance: Suryaansh Jindal, Ojasvi R Singh\nStrategy: Atmajyoti Ghosh, Arya Vardhan Singh, Jash Mody\n2024-2025\nGovernors\nArnav Bansal\nAnshul Trehan\nHeads\nAnalytics: Arya Dighde\nFinance: Aman Samriya, Manya S.

        "content": "Gopali Youth Welfare Society\ncommonly abbreviated as\nGYWS\nis a government-registered NGO in West Bengal and aims to improve the living standards of people in Gopali village. The organisation was started in 2002 and registered on 20 April 2005 under the West Bengal Societies Registration Act, 1961.  It is mainly run by the students of IIT Kharagpur with the help of professors of IIT Kharagpur and local citizens of Gopali village. It mainly focuses on Child education along with Women Empowerment, Eradicating Child Labor among many other causes.\nThe organisation has initiated several programs of free education, social awareness campaigns and vocational training.\nHistory\nThe organisation was started in 2002 by Mrinal Kanti Bhanja, and registered on 20 April 2005 under the West Bengal Societies Registration Act, 1961. It is mainly run by the students of IIT Kharagpur with the help of professors of IIT Kharagpur and local citizens of Gopali village. Jagriti Vidya Mandir was started in the year 2008 in a rented campus, and was shifted to a permanent campus in the year 2012. LIGHT, the pan- India expansion initiative of the socity, was started in the year 2017.\nInitiatives\nJagriti Vidya Mandir\nMarking illiteracy as its prime concern, GYWS embarked on an education program in April 2008: Jagriti Vidya Mandir, an English Medium primary school. Its main motto is \"not to make the children literate, but to make them educated.\nFoundation Day:\nIt is conducted in the month August every year. Members of GYWS conduct events and various competitions for the children.\nTeachers’ Day:\nWe celebrate Teachers’ Day in our school to show our respect to our teachers and to make our students know the importance of teachers in life.\nSports Day:\nIt is the annual sports meet conducted in our school. It is conducted in the month of October.\nRepublic Day:\nSpeech by the chief guest, flag hoisting followed by the performances of the children takes place.\nAashayein:\nIt is the Annual day celebration of our school in which the students of JVM come and perform in IIT KGP so that they get a broad platform. Generally, it takes place in the month of March.\nPrayas\nSkill development\n: Under this initiative, our objective is to impart skills to the youth first so that they can become an earning hand for their family.In this program, we train and develop educated but unemployed youth in line with industry requirements and provide them employment opportunities.\nLive Project\n: Live Project is the channel to put the budding managers on the track of social work. The project involves in selecting the potential candidates from the various institutions giving them the liberty to work on a problem and expanding the scope of the work.\nGreenovation:\nIt is an ambitious project aimed at introducing low cost and organic farming techniques to farmers of nearby areas of kharagpur. School children are also involved so that they can develop  interest in agriculture.\nUdyat\nUnder Teacher Training ,the PG and RS students try to help the teachers to improve their ability to teach.The students of JVM are taught how to operate computers in this initiative.We plan to extend this initiative for the students of other schools too.A weekly Science based fun activity has been conducted in Jagriti Vidya Mandir. Objective is to bring gleams in the eyes of children while learning in school. The students conduct sessions to project curious science and textbook fundamentals in an Involved manner.Along with the regular school, JVM students are also taught on Sundays.They are motivated to study hard and also are given coaching for JNV entrance test.\nLiGHT\nLiving In Greater Horizons Together. After the success of strategies and plans of the Gopali Youth Welfare Society (GYWS) near the area of IIT Kharagpur, the society planned to reciprocate similar models of social upliftment throughout the nation.LIGHT currently has four centers-Bhopal(MP), Gaya(Bihar), Kancheepuram(Tamil Nadu), Samvedana(Maharashtra).\nOther Initiatives\nPaperkraft\nAimed ‘ Generating Employment, Preserving Environment and empowering women ‘ , As part of this project, students volunteer to collect old newspapers from the Halls of Residences of IIT Kharagpur. These are given to poor rural women, free of charge, to make into ‘thongas’ or paper bags. Currently 30 women are associated with the production process who were given a week long training to make thongas.\nPaperKraft thus provides an opportunity to the destitute women to become self-employed. Also it promotes a cleaner and greener environment as it recycles degradable waste materials into something and also provides a viable substitute to plastic bags which are non-biodegradable. Thus PaperKraft is a sustainable, employment-generating, and environment friendly.\nKGP BloodConnect (K.B.C.)\nK.B.C.\n[\n1\n]\nis an initiative started by Gopali Youth Welfare Society &\nStudent Welfare Group -IIT Kharagpur\n.\nIt was realised by us that whenever there is a requirement of blood, many people are willing to donate blood but due to some or the other reasons communication gap becomes their barrier and as a result prompt help doesn't reach to the patient which is very essential in case of an emergency .\nK.B.C.  can become a sailing medium of contact for the donor and patient and this particularly is our motto along with spreading awareness about blood donation behind starting such a program.\nK.B.C. is also associated with '\nKharagpur Voluntary Blood Donor Organisation (KVBDO)'\nand have contacted the local hospitals of Kharagpur including Kharagpur Railway Hospital.\nIt's not that K.B.C is only for the students but it will benefit local people in and around Kharagpur.\nPedals for Progress\nSome of the kids need to travel long distances to come to school and then go back again. Owing to these hectic travel, GYWS initially booked a Cab to supplement their requirements. But the cab has been unable to reach out every child because of which students either walk down the road or their parents have to go with them. So, GYWS members collect bicycles from passing out IIT Kharagpur students, repairs them and gives them to the JVM children. In this way, children coming from far off places can travel comfortably.\nActivities\nYogdaan\nYogdaan is an initiative taken by GYWS in which the members go door to door of each and every student of IIT Kharagpur campus and request them for donation for their school construction project.Since last 3 years they have been doing yogdaan annually and have been getting a very good response from them every year. With the wholehearted support from students in the very first year of yogdaan, GYWS had bought land for school construction, and from the fund of next yogdaan, two classrooms had been completed there and from last year's yogdaan fund, the work is in progress currently, and the good news is that school has been started in new campus.\nSpring Fest Stall\nWhile everyone gets busy enjoying during the glamorous\nSpring Fest\n, GYWS Members in turn look after the stall which is majorly prepared to promote the activities and partially to collect funds  for the betterment of the children.\nAnnual Day\nLike every other school, JVM also celebrates Annual Day, which has been named Aashayein, with full flair. First Annual Day was held in 2009. Support by advisory committee and presence of dignitaries which includes\nDirector, IIT Kharagpur Prof. Partha Pratim Chakraborty\nhas helped GYWS & JVM celebrate annual days without any serious concern with limited monetary resources.\nObjectives\nTaking part in promoting education for the children belonging to destitute families.\nMaking people aware of the rights, duties and responsibilities as an individual, a villager, a citizen.\nProviding preventive, promotive and curative health care services for the people in general and women and children in specific.\nEmpowering the rural women through microfinance and Self Help Group(PAPERKRAFT).\nImparting vocational training for rural youth with a view to making them self – supportive and acquiring skill suited to their needs.\nTo give emphasize on food security of the community as well as right to safe drinking water and healthy sanitation.\nTo provide support to the vulnerable person materially and emotionally.\nTo initiate an appropriate early childhood development and rehabilitation of the children with disabilities including older persons.\nDevelopment of micro – level infra structural facilities.\nPromotion of local resources to function as self-sustaining development units.\nIntegration of crop cultivation, agri – horticulture, agro – forestry, livestock rearing and fish culture and increase their production.\nBuilding confidence among the target groups to create their own resources and recycle those in sequential manner for sustainability.\nEradication of Child Labour\nMedia Recognition\nGYWS is being recognized by various media and prominent personalities for the noble work done by the group. Following are the testimonials for the organization in recent past -\nIITians run school to bridge social divide - The Times Of India\n[\n2\n]\nIITians take education beyond Hallowed Campus - The Telegraph\n[\n3\n]\nDainik Bhaskar\n[\n4\n]\nPratidin\n[\n5\n]\nAppreciation from Mr. Roy Da Silva, President of IIT Foundation\n[\n6\n]\nReferences\n↑\nK.B.C.\n↑\nThe Times of India\n↑\nThe telegraph\n↑\nDainik Bhaskar\n↑\nPratidin\n↑\nRoy Da Silva, President of IIT Foundation\nAnnual report 13-14\nAudit report 13-14\nExternal Links\nGopali Youth Welfare Society Official Website\nGopali Youth Welfare Society Facebook Page\nGopali Youth Welfare Society Linked Profile\nGopali Youth Welfare Society Google Plus Profile\nGopali Youth Welfare Society Twitter Handle\nGopali Youth Welfare Society Youtube channel\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Gopali_Youth_Welfare_Society&oldid=146264\n\""

        "content": "Syllabus in ERP\nCourse offered by CCDS, IIT Kharagpur\nPrerequisites\n: None\nObjective\n: This subject is primarily designed for students who would be working on applications that require basic understanding of the high performance computing (HPC) environment, but may not necessarily have a computer science background. The objective of the subject is to (1) Introduce the basic concepts related to HPC architecture and parallel computing; (2) To discuss various computational techniques for studying soft matter systems, and (3) To apply these concepts to examine complex biomolecular/materials systems that generally require large-scale HPC platform with hybrid CPU-GPU architectures. Hands-on tutorial sessions will provide an exposure to the students in using CPU and GPU based servers of a supercomputer (or local servers) to perform simulations and analysis of such complex systems. Upon attending the course, the students will be equipped with both theoretical and practical knowledge and skills of effectively using a large supercomputing platform and computational methods to solve and evaluate real-world problems in materials science and biology.\nContents and Lecture Hours (L,T):\nComponent 1: Introduction to HPC architecture and parallel programming (11L, 4T)\n• Basic architecture and organization: memory heirarchy, shared and distributed memory architectures, multiprocessor architecture\n• Introduction to thread level parallelism\n• Accelerators (GPU, Xeon-Phi)\n• Performance prediction and evaluation\n• Parallel programming/computing: Introduction to MPI/ OpenMP, basics of CUDA programming.\n• Optimizing cluster operation: Running jobs in HPC environment, job scheduler, cluster level load balancing\nComponent 2: Special methods for studying complex systems (15L, 4T)\n• Basics of statistical mechanics\n• Potential energy surface\n• Introduction to molecular mechanics\n• Simulation methods: Molecular Dynamics (MD), Monte Carlo (MC) simulations\n• Enhanced sampling methods\n• Coarse-grain modeling\nComponent 3: Applications to complex systems (14L, 6T)\n• Open-source software: MD and MC simulation packages\n• Parallelization in software: domain/spatial decomposition, distribution of non-bonded interactions, dynamic load balancing, multiprocessor communication\n• Modeling of soft matter systems such as biomolecules, polymers, carbon nanostructures etc.\n• Computation of thermodynamic, kinetic and mechanical properties of different complex systems\nThe above information can also be found at this link -\nhttps://erp.iitkgp.ac.in/InfoCellDetails/resources/external/groupemailfile?file_id=274\nConcepts taught in class\nProgramming in Fortran90 with hands on sessions\nUsing Open MPI Library for parallel programming in Fortran\nIntroduction to Molecular Dynamics\nHands on Demo on Molecular Dynamics softwares like VMD, Packmol\nBasics of Computer Architecture, Parallel Computing Architecture, HPC Architecture\nLimits and Costs of Parallel Programming - Amdahl's law\n(The concepts may vary from year to year depending upon the time availability)\nStudent Opinion\nIf you are interested in learning FORTRAN and basics of parallel programming, this course will be useful for you. This course is mainly for people interested in the fields of Molecular Simulations and HPC. However, if you are interested only in computing aspects, not Simulation aspects, you can take the other course offered by CCDS in Spring Semester -\nCD61002 - High Performance Scientific Computing.\n(Read more about the courses offered by CCDS\nhere\n)\nFORTRAN, though an old language, is popular among scientific community, and use it widely in HPC codes. The best part about the course is that emphasis is laid on hands on for FORTRAN, Open MPI and parallel computing, and the pace is comfortable even for a beginner in programming. Do take the course, if you are interested in working in this field. This course is mostly offered in Autumn Semester.(Do check ERP, things may change)\nResources\nAn amazing guide for Parallel Computing\nA good resource on using MPI, the codes are in C language, but the concepts are explained well here\nVideo explaining the basics of Molecular Dynamics\nFortran code Snippets\n,\nMPI code Snippets\nwritten by a random guy in class\nCode Snippets\nwritten by another random guy in class\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=CD61004:_High_Performance_Computing_and_its_Applications_in_Complex_Physical_Systems&oldid=174859\n\""

It is split into 2 halves - Experiments and Term project. The design project has 50 % weightage and the experiments last only up to midsems, after which the lab hours are spent on review meetings. The project topics are chosen by the students and the final presentation is given usually just after the endsems. The students have to make something as part of the project, a mechanism, a new design or something similar and perform an experiment.\nAs far as the experiments are concerned, this lab is much more hands-on and thus more enjoyable.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nThe lab examination would have the group perform an experiment from scratch, which means you would have to set up the experiment, which is something we usually don't do as the experiments are usually set up for the students. So pay attention to the set up, the mounting mechanism, sensors calibration, tunnel  when the experiment is done for the first time.\nThe reports are checked strictly and plagiarism is not tolerated, so put in some effort for the same. The report format and detailed instructions will be circulated regarding the same. Well researched reports with original thoughts would help in scoring. For full marks, be prepared to read research papers and quote from them. Feedback is given and is quite helpful.\nTo score well in the design project, work from day 1 consistently and keep communicating with the professor and the TAs. Try to finish the manufacturing and experiments early, as these often lead to delays. Choose a good team, where people are willing to work. This is extremely important. Before choosing a topic, talk to the seniors who have worked on it before, else you might end up repeating their work.\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nIn Dept\nIn Dept\nIn Dept\nIn Dept\nThursday\nFriday\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=AE39001:_Aerodynamics_Lab&oldid=96684\n\""

It is the most prominent cultural association in the IIT KGP and performs its activities so that the people can savor the brilliance of Telugu culture, arts, and cuisines. TCA gathers all the Telugu people in one place, strengthening solid social bonds and creating an environment for the preservation and growth of Telugu culture\nHistory\nKharagpur has been historically known by the alias “Second Andhra” because of the Telugu diaspora from then Andhra Pradesh settling at Kharagpur for Railway jobs and IITKGP being the first premiere institute of the Nation.\nTCA was founded in the 1960s by Telugu professors to celebrate Telugu festivals and uphold a culture far from home. The body used to function as an association wherein funds were raised amongst the professors to organize traditional events and festival celebrations. As time progressed, in the '90s, students residing on campus began attending the events and participated in a few. By the early 2000s, there was harmony between the students, faculty, and staff bodies.\nDue to the rising internet culture, the advent of social media, and the ever-growing number of students from the Telugu States, students have become an integral part of the association since 2012. To cater to this, a separate section of the association was formed in October 2023, now known as the Students’ Telugu Cultural Association.\nVision\nStudents’ TCA aims to build a community that promotes Telugu culture and unites people to celebrate our rich heritage and share our love for our language, music, dance, and art. This is done by organizing the plethora of events celebrated in the Telugu states. Though times change and new trends kick into the Gen-Z population, we believe in a Culture-holistic approach to organize events and maintain a home-like environment for the Telugu junta.\nStructure\nThe heads are called “Joint Secretaries” and are 4 in number. They are usually 4th year undergraduate students. One of them must be a female undergraduate student pursuing a dual-degree course at IITKGP. A new post was introduced in 2023 Spring when TCA was restarted by a group of 5th-year Telugu undergraduate students, headed by\nKumidhini Kesana\n, who then became the “Governor” of TCA. According to the constitution drafted by the succeeding team, the position of Governor will be discontinued from the 2025 Autumn semester.\nThe rest of the crew includes third--, second-, and first-year students, termed “Members” of the association. Finally, an advisory board is nominated by the faculty edition of TCA consisting of two professors or staff to guide and advise the student body, formalize the proceedings of every event thus acting as a bridge between STCA and TCA.\nEvents\nTelugu Cultural Association has organized festival celebrations such as Bhogi, Sankranthi, FETE, Ugadi, Sri Rama Navami, Vinayaka Chavithi, and Cultural Night. STCA decided to take it a step further and develop the association into a community addressing all the sociocultural aspects of the Telugu junta. These include but are not limited to:\nSPRING\nBhogi and Sankranthi\nShivaratri cinema screening\nHoli Flashmob\nFundae Session\nUgadi\nSri Rama Navami\nAUTUMN\nFreshers Introduction\nTreasure Hunt\nTelugu Bhasha Dinotsavam\nVinayaka Chavithi\nJanmashtami cinema screening\nCultural Night\nTCA has conducted guest talks with eminent spiritual personalities in Telugu, such as Chinna Jeeyar Swamy Chaganti Koteswara Rao. STCA has taken it a step further to host a guest talk by Padmasri Awardee Dr. Garikipati Narasimharao on topics ranging from dealing with academic stress to adopting an ideal student lifestyle.\nMedia and Internet coverage\nTCA has been operating its\nYouTube channel\nsince 2011, and music and dance performances during the events are uploaded. The responses have been tremendous, with over 50,000 subscribers, 340 videos, and 20M+ views.\nSeveral Sankranthi and Ugadi celebration clippings have been in local Bengali and regional Telugu newspapers such as\nEenadu\n.\nA Popular Telugu production house and social media content team, “Chai Bisket,” has featured TCA on “15 Rocking “College Dance Performances” on YouTube, which is worth a watch.”\nThe new\nInstagram page\n, launched in April 2023, has quickly gained the attraction of many, with 90,000+ impressions and a solid interaction rate. The posters, event teasers, and after-movie videos have gained great appreciation from the Telugu junta for their quirky editing and excellent quality.\nHeads, Governors & Joint Secretaries\nAcademic Year\nPosition\nNames\n2023-24\nGovernors\nTridev Rapeti\nVikas Nalli\nJoint Secretaries\nAbhirama Gorti\nSuvvari Venkata Sai\nAkhila Chukka\nMohan Chandu\n2022-23\nGovernors\nKumidhi Kesana\nVijayavardhan Pasagadugula\nJoint Secretaries\nTridev Rapeti\nVaibhav Machavarapu\nVikas Nalli\n2020-21\nHeads\nThriloknath Palla\nAbhi Reddy\nManoj Nagireddy\nSreeja Karem\n2019-20\nHeads\nSurya Vishal\nSneha Vinjam\nPrudhvi Kintada\nAkhil Netrambaka\n2018-19\nHeads\nManish Asa\nNarmeta Shashank\nPrasanna Kumar Mulagalapalli\nVangala Raviteja\n2017-18\nHeads\nAakash Sangani\nMuni Lohith Konidala\nPranitha Sriramoju\nVedasheersh Boorla\n2016-17\nHeads\nMythri Tg\nPrathyusha Dabbara\nRavi Yenugula\nRenukrishna Gutta\n2015-16\nHeads\nAkshay Kumar\nKumarbabu Ghanta\nGontla Prathyusha\n2014-15\nHeads\nAravind Chebolu\nGeeta Sravanthi\nKishore Reddy\nSpandana Korabandi\n2013-14\nHeads\nAshok Reddy\nUsha Rani\nKiran Kumar\nJai Sankar\n2012-13\nHeads\nSampath MVSS\nSreekanth Reddy\nKrishna Vamsi\nSri Pooja\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Telugu_Cultural_Association&oldid=239446\n\""

Likewise, we also need a new breed of engineers with intricate knowledge of the complexities of medical and biological sciences. In the year of its Golden Jubilee in 2001, the School of Medical Science &Technology (SMST) was started at\nIIT Kharagpur\nwith the objective to provide a platform of interdisciplinary teaching and research in diverse areas of medical science and technology. The School has collaboration with some of the best medical research institutes and medical industries from all over the world. The School introduced an interdisciplinary 3 years Masters Program in Medical Science and Technology (MMST) - first of its kind in the country. Admission to the MMST program is granted to MBBS doctors each year on the basis of the performance in an entrance test conducted all over the country. The MMST program offered by the School is the only comprehensive physician-scientist training program in India which aims to bridge the gap that has historically separated biological sciences from engineering and physical sciences. The school also offers a 4 semester M.Tech program in Medical Imaging &Informatics. SMST also offers PhD programs. Several students from the school have received prestigious awards and fellowships like Nehru-Fulbright, Khorana, DAAD scholarships etc. The School has a number of well-equipped state-of-the-art laboratories and is supported by an excellent faculty, in addition to many other faculty members from different departments of the Institute who have contributed considerably in building up these programs.\n[\n1\n]\nProf.\nSuman Chakraborty\nis currently the Head of the School .\nResearch Areas\nAtherosclerosis and non-coding RNAs\nBiomedical devices, Flexible electronics\nBioMEMS\nBone Regeneration & Bone Tissue Engineering\nCardiac developmental biology\nResearch Laboratories\nAmmunology\nBio-Instrumentation\nBiomaterials And Tissue Engineering\nBio-Mems\nBiostatistics\nReferences\n↑\nhttp://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/MM\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=School_of_Medical_Science_and_Technology&oldid=17976\n\""

        "content": "There are many courier service insides the campus. One may come across the need to avail courier facilities in Kharagpur due to the weight-restraints on flights, or carry sports goods or other instance.\nSending package from the campus\nThere are following courier services in Kharagpur:\nIndia Post\n: It is located near the sbi office, next to the main gate of IITKGP. Though they usually dont provide you with boxes to pack your stuff\nDTDC\n: It is located behind HMC office. It has good fast services, provide with packing material though costlier than Indian post\nBlue Dart\n: It is located near CCD, next to Baskin Robbins.\nFirst Flight\n: It is located in Tech market. It has good cost value for sending sports goods. Be careful with the prices though, the guy who runs the shop often overquotes prices and doesn't fill them into the booking slip when you book a package.\nDTDC - Moving and Large Goods\n: Situated next to Amul Ice Cream shop opposite the gate to Jnan Ghosh Stadium. This shop doesn't have a proper board and can be hard to locate, ask the people around for help. This is particularly useful when you are graduating from college and want to ship your over-sized bags / cartons of books or clothes back home. The rates are reasonable (~Rs. 25 per kg) and the staff are very helpful with packing. They will safely pack your suitcase / carton and ship it. Average time for reaching the destination is about 10 days for metro cities, and 15-20 days for towns and villages. Items are shipped on trucks.\nReceiving packages in the campus\nAll the courier services deliver your package inside the campus, alternatively you can also collect it from their respective offices\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Courier_services_in_the_campus&oldid=44768\n\""
