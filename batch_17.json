It was earlier referred to as the 'Technology Telugu Dramatics Society', TTDS in short. It is under the Technology Students' Gymkhana and is a part of the Dramatics Subcommittee under the Social and Cultural Committee.\nHistory\nThe youngest of all dramatics societies, Technology Dramatics Society - Prasthanam has grown in leaps and bounds since being recognized by the Technology Students' Gymkhana in 2013. It is a society formed to assimilate, perpetuate and integrate the rich culture and dramatics heritage of the Telugu speaking people into the mainstream culture of IIT Kharagpur.\nPrasthanam's main goal is to encourage, nurture and showcase the various talented individuals, helping them reach their potential and realizing the hopes, dreams and aspirations of the seniors and alumni who have worked really hard to bring Prasthanam to where it is now.\nFunctioning\nSelection Procedure\nPrasthanam selection auditions are held once per year, only for first years, in August for an active membership for all four/five years. The society selects a batch of 30-40 first years (UG)  at the beginning of the academic year soon after the welcome production. Selection procedure consists of tasks that judge voice modulation, intensity, speech and diction, confidence and acting skills.\nOrganizational Structure\nPrasthanam has four governors selected by the society seniors every year who govern the society and represent it in the Gymkhana. Overall co-ordination during productions outstations and competitions are handled by the governors.\nList of Activities\nWelcome Production\nWithin two weeks of the Autumn Semester starting, Prasthanam performs its first production of the year. The cast ranges from second years to Third years. The aim of this Production is to Entertain Freshers from Telugu Community with its Comical Plays. This is also the first time the Governors for the new tenure are introduced to KGP.\nFreshers' Workshop\nThe freshers are given a thorough training of theatre oriented workshops that teach them the basics of dramatics. Skills like voice modulation, voice intensity, dramatization, body posture, stage movements, third forms, etc are taught in groups. First years along with the four governors train for three weeks at the Main Building. Occasional skits, monologues and challenging impromptu are attempted to improve the versatility of the actor.\nFreshers' Production\nThe Governors with the help of the entire society train the first years and with rigorous practice put up a production, with the entire cast being first years and background works are done by second years.\nAnnual production\nThe last act of the year (referred to as the Annual Production) is performed during End-March to Early-April. The Annual Production sees the most diverse crowd play together.\nList of Plays\nKill Rose (2019)\nNenu Naa Rakshasi (2018)\nIddaru (2018)\nRao Gaari Abbayi (2017)\nKarna Bharam (2017)\nAahana Pellanta (2016)\nGardhabhandam (2016)\nChadarangam (2016)\nEvadi gola Vadidhe (2015)\nPrathinayakudu (2015)\nAdrustam (2015)\nPlan- B (2014)\nSector-24 Mvp Colony (2014)\nFlash Back (2014)\nProduction No.1 (2013)\nManushulu Chesina Devudu (2013)\nAdhi sir Jarigindhi (2013)\nMettininti Bharatam (2012)\nPellam oorelithe (2012)\n2-Idiots (2012)\nNava Samajam (2011)\nSangarshana (2010)\nGovernors\nList of Governors\n2024-25\nDarapu Adhitya Shivakumar reddy\nYedla Gowthami\nVishnu Teja Jawalkar\nArikatla Charan Teja\n2023-24\nChimata Bhavya Charitha\nMedavarupu Atchutha Rama Murthy\nGadipudi Bindu Sri\nKattepogu Rahul Raj\n2022-23\nNaveen Reddy Jonnalagadda\nPotti Satya Manikanta\nKonathala Baby Sri Jaahnavi\nBellam Tejesh\n2021-22\nDeepak Pinjala\nGottipati Lasya\nSai Supreeth Gudala\nYeduguri Venkata Akash Reddy\n2020-21\nJyotish Vudikavalasa\nAvanthika Didroy\nSravani Burma\nDivakar Sai\n2019-20\nAshok Kumar\nHoma Sattenapalli\nManiteja Tallapally\nPoojitha Pinniboyana\n2018-19\nDharani Chaparala\nGiridhar Boyana\nSatish Chandra Pinjala\nSurya Teja Kemburu\n2017-18\nHemanth Kumar Potluri\nLalasa Dheekollu\nLvs Chaitanya\nRishiKumar Patherla\n2016-17\nApoorva Kavali\nRamakrishna Kamineni\nSandeep Rimmalapudi\nSrikar Ballipalli\n2015-16\nAbhinav Cherukuri\nPrithvi Krishna\nShashank Yadav\nVarshini Bandaru\n2014-15\nNitin Vusirikala\nSamhitha Syamala\nSuresh Blv\nVenki Pullela\n2013-14\nBhanuteja Aryasomayajula\nSudheer Reddy Bora\nHima Sagar Yemineni\nSunandha Banala\n2012-13\nNirup Tnl\nSrisai Ballipalli\nRamya Nagini\nDinesh Babu Ankadala\n2010-12\nPavan Kalyan Gt\nVarun Kalapala\nPandurangam Rathod\nSee also\nPravah\nDruheen\nEncore\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Prasthanam&oldid=239468\n\""

Founded in 2005, copies of\nThe Scholars’ Avenue\nwere initially delivered to all the students on campus, with soft copies being mailed to the faculty and several thousand alumni all over the world.\nEach of the issues is a juxtaposition of the informational, the technical and the creative. ScholsAve reports campus events and happenings, functions as a public interface between students and the administration, summarizes technical advancements taking shape on campus and not the least, prints the funnies. Its pieces include:\nEditorials\n: The editors’ take on the successive issues that have affected IIT Kharagpur’s campus.\nInterviews\n: Interviews with luminaries such as Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Kris Gopalakrishnan, Prahlad Kakkar, KK, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia et al.\nGuest Articles\n: Featured articles from guests.\nCareers Avenue\n: A stab at increasing the horizons of the readers.\nTech Avenue\n: On-campus technical advancements in the spotlight.\nBhaat Avenue\n: Browse through our biweekly dose of humour.\nThe team is drawn entirely from the students of the institute and acts as the voice of the student community by reporting on events relevant to campus. TSA is also a non-profit organization independent of the administration of IIT Kharagpur and is supported by sponsorships and donations.\nEarly Days\n\"There have always been dreamers; because in our dreams we see not what is, but what can be. There have always been doers; because through our efforts, we make what-can-be what-is. This is how things become possible. This is how the quality of our life improves. Because we dream. Because we do. - Daewoo Motors\"\nThe Scholars' Avenue (TSA or ScholsAve) was borne out of one such dream. A dream to give IIT Kharagpur its own newspaper that would act as litmus for the mood on campus and provide a medium that students could capitalise to voice their views. It started off in 2005 with an aim to reach every single room on campus via print issues and soon forayed into online media with the establishment of it's website.\nQuite a number of issues in, The Scholars' Avenue raised the issue of the condition of the B. C. Roy hospital and reported about a strike within campus. Amidst misunderstandings, major decisions were made which included a ban on the Scholars' Avenue and curtailment of its website. The ban lasted less than a month and TSA decided to no longer stay under the Gymkhana – a move that made it free to decide its content but also left it financially crippled.\nThe Website\nThe Scholars' Avenue also has a large readership on their website where news is not the only thing that gets published. They also do a number of articles on different genres as listed below.\nInterviews\nA number of interviews are conducted whenever any major personality is in Campus, during elections, and various other situations that would be of potential interest to the KGP populace.\n||\nLink to the Interview Section\n||\nGuestAve\nGuestAve is an open section where anyone, from a fresher to The Student Senate can publish their articles from, after approaching the team. This section is mostly used by the Alums, The Gymkana, The Student Senate, among others, to convey information to the KGP readers.\n||\nLink to the Guestave section\n||\nInternPedia\nIt is a compilation of answers to the most frequently asked-for metrics and a detailed walkthrough of the nitty-gritty of the process.

The subjects would be a combination of mostly core and some electives.\nStudents aspiring for a Minor in a discipline must register for the same in the beginning of the 5th semester. Only those students, who have a CGPA of 7.5 or above, without any Backlog, will be permitted to register for a Minor. An SGPA or CGPA in excess of 8.0 has to be maintained in the subsequent semesters without any Backlog in order to keep the Minor registration active. Should both the SGPA and CGPA fall below 8.0 at any point after registering for the minor; the Minor registration will cease to be active.\nA student registered for Minor in a discipline must register and pass in all subjects that constitute the requirement for a minor and score a minimum grade point average of 6.00 to be awarded a Minor in that discipline.\nA student may cover these six subjects as either a depth subject, elective subject or a breadth subject or as additional credits. However, he/she has to take at least three subjects as additional credits to earn a minor.\nStudents enrolled in Dual Degree, Integrated M.Sc. and B.Arch.

It is a research group sponsored by\nSRIC\nas part of\nCentre for Excellence in Robotics\n. The aim of the research group is to make autonomous soccer-playing robots and participate in international competitions like\nRobocup\nand\nFIRA Roboworld Cup\n. Undergraduate students from all departments and years are a part of this team. The principal investigator for the project is Prof. A.K. Deb and it is also mentored by\nProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay\n, Prof. D.K. Pratihar and Prof. Sudeshna Sarkar.\n[\n1\n]\nHistory\nThe roots of KRSSG lie with\nTechnology Robotix Society\nas one of the alumni, Aamir Ahmad interned at the\nInstitute for Systems and Robotics (ISR)\nunder\nProf. Pedro Lima\n(former trustee, Robocup Federation), convincing him to bring Robocup to India. Robocup@India challenge was organised by IIT Kharagpur in 2009. This event was the first of its kind in South East Asia and with this India joined the elite body of only 18 nations worldwide to host such a league. Students of IIT Kharagpur itself participated in this event, forming KRSSG. Following the event, KRSSG got faculty attention which prompted Prof. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay and Prof. Sudeshna Sarkar to formally take it up as a research project under them in 2010. This gave KRSSG its first funding from the institute and students started to join the group. With Sanjiban Choudhury and Kaustubh Tripathy taking it as their Bachelor's and Master's Thesis Projects, KRSSG soon grew to expand to a group of 10 students aiming to participate in FIRA 2010. KRSSG participated in FIRA 2010 with purchased robots, held in Bangalore with Sanjiban as the sole representative since it was during mid-semester exams. Although the team was eliminated in the first round, the international exposure proved to be very useful.\n[\n1\n]\nFIRA 2013 Team\nFollowing this, the team started to design their own chassis and circuits. KRSSG then next attempted to participate in FIRA 2012 in Bristol, UK. The team, led by Gaurav Rathi, were all set to leave when their visa was denied. The next iteration, FIRA 2013, was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia which saw successful participation. The mechanical design, circuit fabrication, control code and the AI were all developed by students of the group. FIRA Malaysia was also KRSSG's maiden entry into the Simurosot simulation league. KRSSG was one of only two teams who were using self-manufactured robots in the event along with Team Sahas from IIT Madras. Moreover, FIRA 2013 was the first time an Indian team won a match in FIRA.\n[\n1\n]\nFollowing this, KRSSG participated in FIRA 2014 Beijing, China and FIRA 2015 Daejeon, South Korea.\n[\n1\n]\nList of Student Coordinators\n2009: Kaustubh Tripathi (CS '10)\n2010: Sanjiban Choudhury (EE '11)\n2011: Bittu Sarkar (CS '12)\n2012: Gaurav Rathi (CS '13), Shourav Chakravarty (AE '14)\n2013: Harsh Surana (ME '14), Shourav Chakravarty (AE '14)\n2014: Ashish Daga (ME '16), Soumyadeep Mukherjee (CH '16)\n2015: Akshay Gupta (CS '16), Raunak Dhaniwala (EC '16), Seemant Jay (ME '16)\n2016: Abhinav Agarwalla (MnC '18), Kumar Abhinav (CH '18), Kaustubh Mundhada (EC '17), Dhananjay Yadav (ME '17)\n2017: Gunjan Sengupta (MT '18), Ankit Lohani (CH '18), Rishabh Jain (EE '18)\n2018: Sudarshan Sharma (EC '20), Mayank Bhushan (CS '20), Ankush Roy (ME '20), Buridi Sree Aditya (CS '20)\n2019: Tanishq Jasoria (MnC '21), Ashish Kumar Gaurav (MnC '21), Shivam Kumar Panda (ME '21), Shubhanan Shriniket (CS '20)\n[\n1\n]\nActivities\nRoboCup Four Wheel Robot\nRoboCup Small Size League\nThis project was a result of the success of the RoboCup India Challenge in the campus in August 2009 and led to the formal creation of KRSSG. The aim of this project is to develop a team of autonomous robots in accordance with the rules of International RoboCup Small Sized League. Some notable highlights of this project are the development of a team of omni-directional robots with linear and chip kicker that shoots and chips a golf ball.\n[\n2\n]\nRobocup 3D Humanoid Simulation league\nThe RoboCup 3D Simulated Soccer League challenges control of virtual humanoid team of robots competing against one another in a simulation of the rules and physics of a game of football. This aims to control different kinds of humanoid robot models which has a field of view and also simulates communication between players like in real world soccer. KRSSG started working on this league in early 2015.\n[\n2\n]\nFIRA Mirosot\nThe aim of the project is to develop a team of autonomous robots in accordance with the rules of RoboCup Small Sized League and the Mirosot league of the World Championship conducted by Federation of International Robot-soccer Association (FIRA). This involves development of a team of differential drive robots. KRSSG developed two versions of the Mirosot robots and participated in 4 FIRA Roboworld Cups.\n[\n2\n]\nFIRA Robots\nFIRA Simurosot\nFIRA Simurosot is a simulation league of differential drive robots playing soccer. KRSSG started working on this after 2010. KRSSG has participated in Simurosot in3 FIRA Roboworld Cups.\n[\n2\n]\nHumanoid Robotics\nKRSSG has also started working on humanoid robotics. With students working on simulation league and also trying to get a Darwin Mini playing soccer, KRSSG is also working on designing it's own humanoid and getting it to play soccer.\n[\n2\n]\nCode-o-Soccer\nCode-O-Soccer is a coding competition conducted by Kharagpur RoboSoccer Students' Group in the month of October, the main aim of the event is to introduce the concept of autonomous soccer playing robots in students mind and motivating students to create a challenging strategy using the provided API on a three vs three robot match for which robots are provided by KRSSG.\nIt is going national for the first time in 2015 in collaboration with IEEE.\n[\n2\n]\nWorkshops\nKRSSG also has conducted workshops in IIT Kharagpur with IEEE and Intel to spread the culture of robotics in India and also to display it's work and skills.\n[\n3\n]\nIntel Workshop Presentation by KRSSG\nTeam Structure\nKRSSG Team is divided into four sections:\n[\n2\n]\nAI Team\nAI or Coding Team is the team that develops the strategy and high level control of the robot(s).

Social media plays an important role but a special emphasis is given on personal, face-to-face interactions. During hall days, candidates visit each room for introducing themselves and collecting feedback or plans that they may wish to include in their proposals.\nElection Day\nThe voting is conducted by CIC and Gymkhana officials under the purview of an election officer. Until 2016, the polling booths used to be set up in all halls of residence and votes were cast from 3.30 pm to 7.30 pm. In 2017, however, the polling booths were setup at selected places and halls:\nGymkhana\nPG Halls of Residence\nThe voting was conducted in two phases: i) morning and ii) evening. In some cases when the voter turnout was low, voting times were extended by a consensus. Posters were not allowed this year for eco-friendly reasons.\nControversies\nThere was a controversy regarding the minimum CGPA requirement to contest for VP, which was proposed to be raised to 7.00 (mid-March 2017), allegedly to block the nomination of Devanand Kedia and Mayank Srivastava. The proposal was however rejected.\nDevanand Kedia, in his SOP claimed that he is a co-founder of the website\nInstiinfo\n, but Atal Agarwal (VP TSG 2015-2016), one of the panelist, claimed that his name was added on the website in Feb 2017 and his name was not present in earlier snapshots of the website on\narchive.org\n. Later on 7th August, Shovan Panigrahi (VP TSG 2016-2017) sent an email to students informing them about \"Election Regulation Cell\" which found Devanand Kedia's credential about instiinfo incorrect.\n[\n2\n]\nAwaaz IIT Kharagpur\nraised questions about the timing of the of the email and the verification process.\n[\n3\n]\nThe co-founders of instiinfo.com claimed in a video that Devanand Kedia was also a co-founder.\n[\n4\n]\nThe 5 mentioned co-founders, although were friends in their first year, when the website was launched at the beginning of the next semester, it only mentioned 4 co-founders. A reddit user put together some more evidence denying Devanand Kedia as one of the founders, claiming there were only 4 founders to begin with.\n[\n5\n]\nReferences\n↑\n\"The TSG Elections 2017-18 results\"\n.
