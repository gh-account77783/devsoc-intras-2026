Two wattmeter method of measuring power in three phase circuit (resistive\nload only)\nConcepts taught in class\nAs time passes by, the syllabus keeps on decreasing with the increasing number of failures and the need for DepC Ex's and A's. As far as the session of 2017-18 is concerned, the overall syllabus is as follows:\n1.DC Circuits(Certain topics like Non linear elements have been removed)\n2.AC Circuits\n3.3 Phase Circuits (Unbalanced load not in syllabus)\n4.Transients (Only 1st order transients in DC and AC circuits)\nIn most cases the midsem syllabus is upto this portion.\n5.Magnetic Circuits (hysteresis and eddy current losses(only qualtitaive), relays, an application of magnetic force, basic\nprinciples of stepper motor- these topics are not in syllabus)\n6.Single Phase transformers\n7.3 Phase Induction Motor(Squirrel cage only)\nThe entire syllabus comes in the Endsem paper.\nFrom the session of 2017-18, worksheet type question papers were started for this subject, implying limited space for solving a particular question.\nIn both midsem and endsem papers, there are a total of 6 questions out of which 5 are to be attempted. If someone attempts all 6, then the best 5 will be taken for marking. Each question has several subparts.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9RcWoqXmzaLTYUdnzKhF4bYug3GjGcEc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1XaeVNXKsvzzeCAqstGAG1_io1FhxVyk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1XaeVNXKsvxpQCpOL701qk4gR0DwDc57\n(Machines)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5eh6DsKgSo\n(Auto trnsformer)\nStudent Opinion\nThis is one of the most dreaded subjects in the 1st year curricula. First of all the paper will be completely numerical based, so get ready for hectic calculations(in my endsem paper, my calculator showed 'STACK ERROR' while solving a magnetic circuit ;] ). Nobody can assure you about the quality of professors you can get in your class. So the best thing is to study for yourself. Focus more on numericals rather than only reading theory.\nAs far as grading is concerned, if the coordinator and the profs teaching the subject are peaceful, then each student gets 3-5 Ex's. In 2016-17 when the cooordinator prof was a loaded one, each section had only one Ex. The subject has relative grading.\nIn midsems(comparatively easy) marks cross 50 (for those who have practised damn well may get 60) out of 60. However endsem is the biggest bouncer where even the best students get atmost 82 or 84, after which there is a big gap and marks get down from 70s.\nAttendance in classes and tutorials plays a very important role in your TA marks.\nThe tutorials are of 3 hours and are taken in a alternate manner with the lab. Infact EE19001 Lab marks has 40% weightage of your tutorial test marks and attendance. Try to take maximum help from the TAs by asking them to help you with each and every concept. However be careful, sometimes they might tell you a longer method. So verify it from your professor.\nThe biggest question is 'Where should I practise the numericals from?'. The only answer to this is 'Previous Year Question Papers' and Tutorial Sheets (\nhttp://www.ee.iitkgp.ac.in/faci_et.php\n) on the library website and DC++. There is no book that will ever reach the level of problems given in the paper. However this book might help you a lot :\nhttp://www.engineeringbookspdf.com/download/?file=2925\n.\nhttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0uVd31B7zGEWjRQNlJlX05vdms/edit\nthis book also helps a lot. Also pay attention to your tutorial classes and those moments of time when your prof starts solving sums. I can recommend the pdf version of Thareja for some good questions, but dont rely on the answers.\nInfact for an idea of those complex AC DC circuit problems you can search for IES/ESE Conventional Papers for ECE and EE branches. Surprisingly they are very similar to the questions asked in exams.\nGenerally class tests are not taken. Be ready for a 30 minute 10 marks test in the beginning of the tutorial class. Do prepare well for it because it is the only thing to save you when your midsem and endsem marks go down.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nInstiinfo Repository\nTime Table\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=EE11001:_Electrical_Technology&oldid=203168\n\""

A student would be allowed to register in an additional subject only if he/she satisfies the pre-requisite, there is no clash in the timetable and the class size permits.\nOnce a student has registered in an additional subject, the grade obtained (including F-grade) in that subject would invariably be recorded in his/her grade card. The credit contribution of these additional subjects to the computation of CGPA, however, would be considered as nil.\nThe GPA of the additional subjects is separately calculated and indicated in the grade card.\nA student can drop an additional subject following the proper procedure within 3(three) weeks from the commencement of the semester; otherwise, the subject will remain registered and the subject will be mandatorily reflected on the Grade Card even with F grade.\nThere is no scope for a supplementary examination in an additional subject.\nStudent can get\nMinor\nfrom other departments by completing required number of credits and full filling the requirements.\nMicro Credits\nMicro-Credit courses are one credit courses having duration of 3‐14 days offered during the semester or during evening or free slots available during weekdays or even weekends that are not declared holidays in some special cases when students are available.\nThe subject will be counted for total credit requirement for completion of degree in special cases subject to recommendation of the Head and approval of Dean (UGS) with due reasons recorded.\nThe subject and grade will be mentioned in transcript / grade card and will be used to compute CGPA for additional subjects and will be shown as ACGPA. Failures will be marked by F grade. There will be no supplementary examination for such subjects. The F grade will be changed only if the subject is offered again and the student is allowed to register and clear the subject. However, in case the micro-credit is accepted as a subject contributing to the curricular requirement, it will be accounted for in the CGPA calculations.\nA student is normally not expected to take more than 2 such courses in a semester. The subject may also be a part of minor and micro‐specialization.\nReferences\nUG Regulation Document\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Additional_course&oldid=19084\n\""

You can practice problems from a number of books like Fox and McDonald, Som and Biswas etc. But you even not need to do problems from books if you get tutorials in the class.\nIt also serve as a prerequisite for heat transfer course in your 5th semester.\nBooks:-\n1) Fox and McDonald\n2) Som and Biswas\n3) Kundu and Kohen\n4) Cengel and Cimbala\nHow to Crack the Paper\nFor exam,firstly you should have confidence in your basic concepts. You should try to complete your tutorials and class problems for a decent practice. For more questions, you can refer above mentioned books. But the exam wouldn't have, generally, hard questions. You just need clarity in your concepts and a decent practice to solve questions in the exam.\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\n14ME Batch Course Repository\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nNC244,NC242,NC243,NC241\nThursday\nNC244,NC242,NC243,NC241\nFriday\nNC244,NC242,NC243,NC241\nNC244,NC242,NC243,NC241\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=ME21101:_Fluid_Mechanics&oldid=60521\n\""

Some topics and modules are completely new. However the approach is quite different from JEE and looks at the subject in a very different perspective. The basic and complete syllabus is defined by the slides provided by the Profs and is your main study materials. Do attend classes if attendance is taken especially Organic and Inorganic because the questions asked in exams are quite different and requires the skills and concepts taught in class.\nPrevious years practice papers are a must as questions are repeated quite often but don't expect anything about the paper as it might turn the other way round which had happened in Autumn Sem where quite lengthy and involving numericals were asked which required application of multiple formulae and concepts. No theory based descriptive questions are asked except 1-2 from Inorganic section.\nOnline and offline class tests will be taken: 6 marks Physical, 7+7 marks for Inorganic and Organic.\nMust attend tutorials of Organic (you will realise the reason quite soon :) )\nHow to Crack the Paper\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nInstiinfo Repository\nTime Table\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=CY11001:_Chemistry&oldid=56412\n\""

It was conceived as a platform for the students of IIT Kharagpur to showcase their extra academic skills. Over the years, it began to attract  participants from the neighboring colleges of West Bengal. In the last decade or so, the fest grew manifold in scale, attracting participants from all over India and as well as abroad. The 2015 edition of the fest received a footfall of over 50,000 people.\nActivities\nDuring the fest, students from IIT Kharagpur and from different colleges all over the country participate in a multitude of social and cultural activities.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\nThe ambit of the events encompasses various genres like Dance, Music, Dramatics, Photography, Literature, Quizzing and Fine Arts.\n[\n9\n]\nTremendous participation and aggressive competition are seen in all the events, especially the flagship events of SF, namely - Nukkad, Shuffle, Wildfire, Rangmanch, Centrifuge, Lake Side Dreams, etc. The preliminary rounds of Nukkad, Shuffle and Wildfire happen nationwide. Every city that Spring Fest visits to conduct prelims, the whole atmosphere turns festive and the creative lot throng to the venue to see the show of talent.\nOther non-competition based events include\nHard-Talk\nwhich involves talks/conferences by eminent personalities from a variety of fields and IIT KGP Model United Nations, one of the biggest MUNs that take place in Eastern India. The number of these events is particularly large and serves to cater to the very large number of participants — both local as well as from other colleges all over the country.\nThe hub for major activities during the fest is called the\nArena\n, which has the\nInformals\nand\nPerpz\nstage. The informals stage hosts various fun filled casual activities, for which the participants can win numerous prizes. The Perpz stage is an all day dance floor with a DJ, that attracts huge crowds. Apart from this the arena also has numerous food and corporate stalls.\nPro Nites\nThe evenings are notable for the \"Pro-Nights\", more commonly known as\nStar-Nites\n— the biggest events in Spring Fest which usually involve live concerts by some of the most famous musicians and bands of national and international acclaim. All the Star Nites are free to attend for any student of the institute and all registered participants. The genres of music are wide and varied and involve pop, rock and fusion bands. The venue for these events is the\nTagore Open Air Theater\n(TOAT) and\nJnan Ghosh Stadium\nwhich usually get packed to their full capacity during the\nStar-Nites\n, with crowds of up to 23,000 people. Famous Indian artistes like\nSalim-Sulaiman\n,\nPritam\n,\nKailash Kher\n,\nKK\n,\nS. P. Balasubramaniam\n,\nShaan\n,\nSunidhi Chauhan\n,\nVishal-Shekhar\n,\nShweta Pandit\n,\nShankar Mahadevan\n,\nShivamani\n,\nSukhwinder Singh\nand classical performers such as\nPt. Debashish Bhattacharya\n,\nPandit Hariprasad Chaurasia\n,\nL. Sriram\n,\nPandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt\n,\nPandit Divyang Vakil\nhave performed here. Bands like\nPentagram\n,\nSwarathma\n,\nUnderground Authority\n,\nKryptos\n,\nParikrama\n,\nEuphoria\n,\nIndian Ocean\n,\nStrings\n,\nSpunk\netc. have also been performing here.\nInternational bands like\nBreathe, the Floyd Sound\n,\nMonuments\n,\nLed Zepplica\nand\nTesseracT\nhave also performed on the famous Spring Fest stage.\nEvents\nJustifying its slogan, Spring Fest has always been ‘The True Spirit of Youth’ and encompasses aspirations and enthusiasm of college students across the nation. A plethora of more than 60 events ranging from varied genres provides a platform to the students where they can prove their mettle and caliber. With a myriad of fun and intellectually stimulating events, huge star nights every year and a versatile crowd profile, Spring Fest has gradually consolidated its position as the premier inter-collegiate fest. The fierce competitions, uninterrupted entertainment, breath-taking pro-shows, and something to suit everybody is what gives SF its magnificence.\nThe fest has three national level events-\nWildfire\n- the national level rock band competition,\nShuffle\n- the street dance competition and\nNukkad\n- the street play competition. Wildfire attracts registrations from hundreds of bands and prizes in the 2014 edition were worth more than 4 lakh INR. Most of the socio-cultural activities are day events which involve dramatics, music, dance competitions, fine-arts contests, quizzes, gaming and other literary events. Judges of the competitions are reputed and famous personalities from different fields and organisations. One notable event is\nModel United Nations\nwhich is an academic simulation of the United Nations Organization where participants take on the  role of representatives of countries/organizations in a UN council, discussing world  issues.\nCentrifuge\n, the inter-collegiate dance event is arguably the most keenly followed event of the fest. The other notable events are\nRangmanch\n, the inter-collegiate Dramatics event,\nSargam\n, the eastern musical jamming competition and\nMary Bucknell Trophy\n, the prestigious quiz competition.\nNotable Guests\nEvery year many esteemed personalities of different fields from around the country are invited as guests and judges for different events and competitions.

The fest has attracted a large amount of coverage from the electronic and print-media.\nMTV\nIndia and\nThe Telegraph\n, Kolkata, have covered the fest extensively in the previous years. Numerous articles have appeared about Spring Fest in various newspapers all over India.\nStructure of the Organization\nThe Spring Fest team is composed of the core team, the design team and the web team. The core-team consists of third years, called the core organizing team heads and second years who form the core organizing team members. The core team is responsible for getting sponsorship for the fest, handles publicity throughout India and organizes and executes the events. Pre-fest tasks, formulation of events, internal publicity, security, student accommodation, transportation, guest reception, and arena design etc. are distributed among the heads and members of the core organizing team.The previous years' core team heads are called\nSteering Committee Members\n. They provide guidance to the core-team over important issues.

This course is intended for students who are familiar with digital processing concepts, preferably those who are majoring in electronics or electrical engineering. Try to be in sync with the NPTEL lectures, otherwise you will get bored. Prof doesn't take attendance, hence you may find very small population, hardly 10. But, here is the tip: Attend the classes regularly if you are aiming for an EX.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nGetting an EX in this course is quite easy. The exam paper (both midsem and endsem) consists of two parts: A and B.\nPart A contains short answer type questions. Most questions from this part are similar to the assignment problems available on NPTEL. Hence, do the assignments very thoroughly.\nPart B contains long answer type questions that requires lot of calculations. For acing this part, all you need to make notes of every formula used in this course (with proper explanations what particular term signifies). That's it. That's easy.\nClassroom resources\nStudy material can be found on bit.ly/iitkgpece\n3rd sem > Slides and Assignments > Digital Speech Processing.\nAdditional Resources\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nCET Studio-1\nThursday\nCET Studio-1\nFriday\nCET Studio-1\nCET Studio-1\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=ET60007:_Introduction_To_Digital_Speech_Processing&oldid=121147\n\""

Measures have been taken to prevent you from doing this. There are threats of being fined if your attendance is low. These threats are what makes you work for it against your will.

The speakers arguing for the motion stressed on how the media today drowns the masses in irrelevance and misinformation. The advent of the 24x7 media bodies have embraced sensationalism to stay ahead of their competitors and this hurts the society very dearly. Major arguments against the motion were that the media, however sensationalist and irritating, serves as a very important check to government power in almost all modern democracies. Also, the cumulative impact the media has had, from the press of the French revolution to social media outrage in the Jasmine revolution is unparalleled.\nIndividual Awards\nPosition\nHall of Residence\nName(s)\nGold\nNH\nRishi Mehta\nSilver\nRP\nVivek Aithal\nBronze\nSAM\nPrachi Sharma\nBronze\nRP\nKartikey Pradhan\nTeam Awards\nPosition\nHall of Residence\nName(s)\nGold\nRP\nVivek Aithal, Kartikey Pradhan\nSilver\nAZ\nShushman Choudhury, Shivam Vats\nBronze\nNH\nRishi Mehta, Kartik Pal\nBengali Elocution\nIndividual Awards\nPosition\nHall of Residence\nName(s)\nGold\nRK\nBodhisattya Bhattacharya\nSilver\nLLR\nNayan Mallick\nBronze\nRP\nBastab Saha\nTeam Awards\nPosition\nHall of Residence\nName(s)\nGold\nRP\nBastab Saha, Sohail Ahsan\nSilver\nRK\nBodhisattya Bhattacharya, Arna Ghosh\nBronze\nAZ\nBhaskar Sarkar, Rakesh Samaddar\nEnglish Elocution\nProf. M.

        "content": "Facilities\nThe heart of all the sports activities at Kgp is the \"Technology Student's Gymkhana\" \nIn Gymkhana, there are 4 Badminton courts , pool table , TT tables , Squash court and Gymnasiums for both student and faculty. We also have Basketball courts, Volleyball courts, Tennis court & Swimming Pool at different locations in the campus. Moreover, KGP has 2 ultimate playgrounds. To check their exact location ,please visit our Know the campus link in the footer. \nEven the Halls have some courts , gym utilities and sports facilities. Halls also provide sport equipments to play any sport, and one can borrow them from the hall security office.\nEvents\nThere are many sports events going on in the campus throughout the session.You have to practice hard and brush up your skills for participating in these events since every year the competition keeps growing fiercer. \nIf you play Badminton or TT or Squash or any other individual game or you are an athlete then Fresher's Events is your deal. That's the platform for you to show everyone that you have got what it takes to be among the best. They are generally organised in the month of August. They are not only fun to participate in but also your first step towards your dream,\nTHE INTER IIT\n.\nNext in line, are the Inter Hall Events.They are extremely important not only to the hall but also for the players. In these events teams of every hall play against other hall in order to collect points and fight for the cup of The General Championship, Sports (GC). Hall tempo is at its highest during these events. Once you enter the arena, you will automatically develop so much sento to your hall which you never felt. Last year we experienced it ourselves.\nThis has nothing to do with the topic but I'll still tell you. Last year we were sitting in the front rows of the basketball court cheering for LBS in the inter-hall final against MS, which we won. That was an incredible experience and we felt like we were playing on the court. So we shouted and hooted as hard as possible. And after we won, there was a big scuffle between the two halls, for which we were very much responsible.\nAnyways, getting back on track....\nBe clear that not everyone is cut out to play in GC. You have to attend the practice sessions of the game you want to participate in and then team will be selected by seeing the skill and the tempo of the player. Remember, in Kgp,Tempo always comes before skill. The team selection for individual games are greatly influenced by the Fresher's Events. Practice sessions for GC usually start in the starting of the month of January.\nThe list doesn't end here. We also have Open IIT events in which any one from the campus can participate regardless of his year or hall.They generally occur a few weeks after the winter break. Even the winter vacations are packed up.Inter IIT's take place during that time. The Inter IIT team is also selected on the basis of Inter IIT practice sessions.\nForms\nSome of the facilities provided by the gymkhana require modest fees. To be specific ,they are : Gym , Squash , Billiards & Swimming Pool.\nYou have to fill up the forms which are available on the the Gymkhana website. But number of these forms are limited so you have to be aware when the forms are being released.They are released at the start of each semester.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Sports_Facilities&oldid=10663\n\""

Blooming with it come the innocent first years, unknowing and curious to explore the beautiful campus. Their wish is fulfilled by the Azad hall of residence by organizing KHOJ, a campus treasure hunt for inspiring the first years to explore the campus with friends as a game and make it one of the most memorable event of their stay in IIT KHARAGPUR. It was started in 2000. KHOJ is the first and the biggest event organized exclusively for the first years. Boys and girls of the campus equally participate in it with full zest and zeal. The students are required to form a group of five, and then the teams are given clues of a place in the campus. They are required to unlock the clues, reach the required place and then find the code hidden somewhere at that place. This is done many times until a team unlocks all the clues and is declared the winner and prizes rain in the event with many teams getting prizes just based on their luck! Though the winner of the event may be one team but the enthusiasm the first years show makes everyone a winner. The event brings with itself joyfulness in the entire campus and gives a first year opportunity to interact with his/her batchmates and the campus. The event continues to grow every year bearing a testimony of the saga of the AZAD HALL OF RESIDENCE.\nAlumni Contributions\n1)Mr. Supriyo Sircar(1987) - Basketball Ground\n2)Mr. Bhaskar Dutta (1970) - Music Room\n3)Mr. Subhendu Mandal (1995) - Football Ground\nAzad Hall Anthem\nAzad Hall of Residence is the only hall in IIT KGP to have a Hall Anthem and an Oath of Fire.

The Complex foundation stone was laid by Kapil Sibal, the MHRD in 2010, inaugurated by the IIT Alumni and previous years batches.\nIt is near the Agriculture Department . The food facilities include subway, Nescafe, MFS canteen and Roosters, in the vicinity of the Complex. NCC Activity takes place  outside Nalanda followed by class in Nalanda complex , on every Saturday.\nRoom Ordering In Nalanda\nThe complex has two main entrances, one of which can be reached by going straight from the Agriculture department/Nehru Museum and the other by taking a right turn at the same place. The complex is divided into 7 blocks total, of 3 types: Academic, Rectangular and Circular. It has 5 floors including the ground floor. Each block on each floor consists of 4 classrooms.\nFinding your room at Nalanda complex can be confusing initially. But in reality it is quite simple. Your room number is of the form \"\nNX abc\n\", where X is either A,R or C - representing Academic, Rectangular and Circular, and a,b,c are digits.\na\nrepresents the floor number, b represents the block number, and c represents the classroom. The image\nhere\nshows how to identify the block. For example, NC 341 is located on the circular block near Subway, on the third floor, because it is in the NC4 block.\nInfrastructure\nIIT-Kharagpur is investing Rs 400 crore in its infrastructure expansion in an attempt to double its student and faculty intake and to scale up its academic programmes. Funds have been raised through government grants, alumni and corporate funding.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Nalanda_complex&oldid=179934\n\""
