        "content": "Inheritance Certificate: Meaning, Purpose, and Application Process\nAn\ninheritance certificate\nis an important legal document that helps identify and authorise the rightful heirs of a deceased person’s assets, properties, and investments. It acts as proof of succession and is commonly required for transferring ownership of movable and immovable property, bank accounts, insurance, or pension benefits after someone’s death.\nWhat Is an Inheritance Certificate?\nAn inheritance certificate, sometimes referred to as a legal heir certificate or succession certificate, is issued by the local government or civil authority to confirm the relationship between the deceased and their surviving family members. It ensures that the deceased person’s assets are distributed according to applicable succession laws or family hierarchy.\nWhy Is an Inheritance Certificate Important?\nObtaining an inheritance certificate helps prevent disputes among family members and simplifies the transfer of the deceased’s assets. Financial institutions, insurance companies, and government departments often demand this certificate to verify the claimant’s legitimacy. Without it, legal heirs may face delays or rejections when trying to access bank funds, property documents, or pension benefits.\nWho Can Apply for an Inheritance Certificate?\nTypically, immediate family members such as the spouse, children, or parents of the deceased can apply. In certain cases, siblings or other close relatives may also be eligible, depending on the family structure and applicable state laws.\nHow to Apply for an Inheritance Certificate\nSubmit an Application:\nVisit the local municipal office, Tehsildar’s office, or the online state portal where inheritance certificates are issued.\nProvide Documents:\nAttach essential documents like the death certificate, identity proof of the applicant, address proof, and details of the deceased’s assets.\nVerification Process:\nAuthorities verify the claim by checking the authenticity of documents and confirming family details.\nIssuance of Certificate:\nAfter verification, the inheritance certificate is issued, listing all legitimate heirs.\nLegal Relevance of an Inheritance Certificate\nWhile an\ninheritance certificate\nhelps identify rightful heirs, it does not automatically transfer property ownership. In cases involving complex or disputed estates, a succession certificate issued by a civil court may be required.\nIn summary, an inheritance certificate serves as a crucial legal record for ensuring a fair and lawful transfer of assets. It helps protect the rights of family members and ensures that the deceased person’s estate is distributed smoothly, transparently, and according to the law.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Akansa3213/sandbox&oldid=239665\n\""

It has since been replaced by\nIQPS\n.\nCurrent status\nThis semester we are trying to crowdsource collecting question papers, as the library database of question papers is missing many papers. This is mostly because there is no centralised process for collecting question papers and uploading them.\nWe are also talking to the professors in charge of conducting exams, to figure out if it is possible to obtain question papers directly, but decided not to wait, as it seems easier to just do it ourselves. If we get a large number of uploads, this expanded database should be quite useful for students.\nHow it works\nWhen people send us question papers to email id\n[email protected]\n, we verify that it's legible and correct, convert it to PDF, and host it online.\nFor the question papers available on the library, we crawl the library website to get a list of urls.\nWe build a database of urls to question papers, and tag them with year, subject code, semester, subject name. Most of this process is automated.\nWhen a user visits the MFQP search page, they download the entire index of question papers (a few kb gzipped). We use a fast string matching library along with a custom ranking formula to provide instant results.\nSource code:\nhttps://github.com/metakgp/mfqp/\nand\nhttps://github.com/mfqp-source/\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=MFQP&oldid=239425\n\""

        "content": "The University of Alberta Research Experience (UARE) is a research internship program allowing top senior undergraduate students from key partner universities to conduct research at UAlberta under the supervision of faculty members who are experts in their field. UARE placements are available during winter (January to mid-March) and summer (May to August) for a period of 10-12 weeks.\nUniversity of Alberta International provides full support for participants before, during and after their placement. A formal orientation, professional development seminars, academic networking opportunities, and a poster symposium are all offered to program participants.\nEligibility\nSenior undergraduate students (3rd or 4th year)\nEnrolled in an undergraduate degree program at a designated partner institution (Partner Institutions in India: IIT Bombay, IIT Kharagpur)\nHave a minimum Grade Point Average of 3.0 or B on a 4-point scale (or equivalent etc).\nPast UARE participants are ineligible\nThere are many projects in a number of disciplines like Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Biotechnology, Environmental Engineering etc.\nApplication Procedure\nThe projects for summer are typically posted on their website by mid-September. The deadline to apply for UARE Summer 2016 was October 31, 2015.\nYou must upload the following documents with your online application:\nLetter of intent\nScanned Official Transcript\nResume/CV\nTwo academic references, submitted directly from the referee via the system\nAcceptance Notification\nThe notification of acceptance generally comes as an email between mid December and February.  The official offer letter, along with the immigration package is emailed to the students by mid march.\nPost Acceptance\nStipend\nCurrently the scholars receive a total amount of CAD 5,000 (CAD 2,000 commitment from the UAlberta faculty member or department; CAD 3,000 is funded centrally). A lump sum of CAD 3,000 is given to the students immediately upon arrival. The rest of the stipend, CAD 2,000 is dispatched late June, after the students are granted tax exemption. All the expenses including air tickets, housing and food for the 8 weeks stay in the US are to be borne by scholars from the above mentioned amount.\nLocation\nUniversity of Alberta is located in Edmonton, capital of Alberta, Canada. UAlberta's main campus is located in the centre of Edmonton, just minutes from downtown and surrounded by the beautiful river valley. With a major transit station on campus, there is easy access to the city’s many attractions. During the internship, opportunities to participate in cultural and social events such as city festivals or day trips to nearby attractions are offered on a weekly basis. A trip to the Rocky Mountains is made available to every intern.\nHousing\nInterns are responsible for their own housing. A few students stay in the Lister Centre, but most interns stay in subleased apartments, which are cheaper and available on campus or right outside campus. Since housing is cheaper outside campus, a number of students opt to stay far from the campus and take a convenient 10-15 minute ride to the campus in the LRT. Subleases can be easily found by visiting facebook pages listing sublease ads. Facebook groups formed by the scholars also turn out to be extremely useful sources of information.\nVisa\nThe application process for Canadian work permit visa is smooth. The application process is clearly listed on the Canadian immigration and travel website. Ideally, the VISA is delivered to you within 2 weeks of applying. However, the processing time of a work permit visa is known to vary between 20 days and 2 months. Hence, it is in your best interest to apply as soon as you receive the award letter and all the supporting documents.\nSee also\nList of internship programs\nHow to get a visa to Canada\nExternal Links\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=University_of_Alberta_Research_Experience_Programme&oldid=10682\n\""

It is an organization of the students, for the students, by the students. It functions as two teams:\nThe Central Team\nThe Hall Coordinators Team\nHistory\nThe Counselling Centre was set up in 2009 by the Dean Of Students′ Affairs, IIT Kharagpur as an outcome of his efforts to make the campus a better campus for the entire student community.\nIt provided the students a place where they could easily approach with a problem and leave with a solution. The reach of the Counselling Centre was further extended through the Hall Coordinators Team. However, the increasing strength of students in the campus called for active participation from the students themselves in this cause. This was the scenario which saw the establishment of the Student Welfare Group in August 2011.\nStudent Welfare Group was initially an idea that evolved out of a feeling to perpetuate and nurture a campus life which is hassle-free. Today, it is a dedicated group of students willing to sort out various issues of concern for the students. It plans to emerge as a more successful organization with more activities managed and implemented for the welfare of students.\nVision\nThe aim of SWG is to ensure that every student's life in KGP is hassle free so that they can achieve their potential zenith while their stay in KGP as well as in their professional career. SWG aims to instil a belief in every student that they can achieve all their goals in life. SWG assists students in resolving their difficulties in every field, be it academic or extra-academic & curricular or co-curricular. It aims to create and sustain an environment that promotes personal growth and discovery, the pursuit of healthy minds and bodies, and participation in the creation of a caring community.\nEvents and programmes\nStudent Mentorship Programme\nThis programme involves the guidance and mentorship of every single first year student by a 3rd or 4th year student of the same department. The objective of this programme is to help the first years understand the various aspects of college life, and adapt accordingly. This programme ensures that the hindsight of the Mentor becomes the foresight of the Mentee. The Mentees can benefit immensely from the insight of the Mentor and find the best possible way to utilize their time in the campus. The Student Mentor Programme provides scope for constructive and productive interaction between the freshmen and the experienced seniors, which forms an integral part of college life.\nPDS Doubt Sessions\nAn interactive session organized by the SWG for those who feel like they are lagging behind in the course because of no prior knowledge.\nProgramming and Data Structures\nis an important course of the first year curricula. The instructors are senior students of the institute who try to increase the problem tackling capability of the students, starting from the very basic level and build up their confidence to face the competition. In Friday’s sessions, tutorial sheets are provided to the students and the tutors help them to solve the questions by clearing the doubts of each and every student. In Sunday’s sessions, students are supposed to come with their laptops and they are given a set of programming questions like the ones given in PDS Laboratory classes. The tutors help the students in coding, compiling and running their programs. At the end of the sessions, the instructors also provide printed solution of the tutorial sheet to the students.\nGD/PI Sessions\nStudent Welfare Group in association with Smart Training Institute, a renowned organization for grooming and perfecting\nsoft skills\n, presents an opportunity to boost students' performance at group discussions and personal interviews just as the season for internships and placements begins. The workshop has been a success in the past with most of the students giving positive feedback. Since the collaboration with the private institute is in its early phase, there is a lot of room and scope in future. Taking into consideration the feedback, the SWG aims to provide better workshops in the following sessions.\nPanel Discussion (Wings Of Fire)\nStudent Welfare Group organised a Panel Discussion by the batch of 2010-11. It invited students to open up to the valuable experience shared by the panelists in a discussion encompassing every facet of KGP life, including academics, extracurriculars, sports, societies and PORs. This discussion was very helpful for freshers who had just joined the institute. Panelists shared their vast experience of 4-5 years in KGP. Apart from freshers, a large number of 2nd and 3rd year students also gathered for this panel discussion.\nForeSight\nSWG\npresents\nForeSight\n, a program which provides the campus students a unique interface to connect with the people who have mastered their field and hence get a foresight of their future. It will cover various career related dimensions (placements, internships, FTs, competitions) from the students of the campus as well as alumni of the institute.\nThe Campus Tour\nA campus ride is being organized to acquaint freshers about the important places of the campus that a student needs to know. It begins from Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur (TSG). In 2015, more than 1200 freshers in 28 separate buses were shown the magnificence of the KGP campus with engaging interactions of SWG team with freshers.\nInformation Brochure- A Walk Through\nFor the first time in the history of our campus, printed version of Institute Information Brochure was circulated among all the freshers, thanks to the rigorous efforts of the SWG team and support of the administration. We hope it has helped the freshers batch a lot in their initial days here at KGP.\nISSUE\n[\n1\n]\nElectrical/Mechanics Doubt Sessions\nStudent Welfare Group is proud to announce Electrical and Mechanics Doubt Sessions for the first year UG students with the help of the Vice President, TSG and the faculty of Electrical Technology and Mechanics. The schedule of the doubt sessions is as follows:\nEvery Saturday\nstarting from 29th August, 2015.\nHall Coordinators Programme\nStudent Welfare Group conducts the Hall Coordinators Programme with the help of Hall Coordinators' Team that would work directly with the Counselling Centre for the overall well-being of the fellow peers and thus ensure 'A Hassle-free Kgp Life' !\nKGP Blood Connect\nKharagpur Blood Connect, an initiative of Student Welfare Group (SWG) IIT Kharagpur and Gopali Youth Welfare Society, established to serve the same purpose, is always there to help you in making your contribution, as \"To the young and healthy it’s no loss. To sick it’s hope of life. Donate Blood to give back life.\" It is an endeavour of ensuring that no one on campus struggles to find a blood donor in times of need!\nPublic Speaking Forum\nSWG has come with Public Speaking Forum , a platform which'll make you aptly equipped to fight the fear of Public Speaking.

This course covers all those concepts as well as some additional concepts like variable mass, center-force motion, Kinetics of 3-D rigid bodies etc. You can think of this course as a continuation of JEE mechanics. This is also a continuation of mechanics course you did in your 1st year. But those concepts are rarely used here.\nThis course also serve as a prerequisite for further departmental courses like Kinematics of Machines in your fourth semester.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nFrom examination point of view, firstly you should practice the class problems well, as some questions in the exam will be very similar to those already done in the class with some extension or little modifications. You should emphasize on the concepts mainly taught in the class rather than doing more and more questions. Once class questions are done you should do your tutorials for a decent practice. This much work is sufficient but still if you have time you can solve problems from Meriam and Kraige. It's more than enough if you have clarity in your concepts.\nBooks\n1) Meriam and Kraige Volume II\n2) Beer and Johnston\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\n14ME Batch Course Repository\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nNR421\nThursday\nNR421\nFriday\nNR421\nNR421\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=ME20001:_Dynamics&oldid=137417\n\""

It organises the annual Space Technology and Astronomy themed fest,\nNational Students' Space Challenge\n[\n1\n]\n(NSSC) every year since 2011.\nspAts\nignites a passion for space exploration at IIT Kharagpur by organizing talks, discussions, stargazing sessions, lectures, and presentations.\nThe group publishes a bi- semester newsletter, '\nThe Moonwalk\n', which features on latest ventures in space technology and astronomy related articles and developments.\n[\n2\n]\nHistory\nThe Space Technology Students' Society was founded way back in 2008 by a group of students extremely enthusiastic about the frontiers of space technology. It was formed as an official student body under the Kalpana Chawla Space Technology Cell (KCSTC). Since then, the society has grown in size and activities. The idea of a national level space-oriented fest was conceived and thus implemented as the National Students' Space Challenge (NSSC) in the year 2011. NSSC has been successfully organised for twelve more editions since then.\nA subgroup of spAts, the FQTQ team which is a dedicated Astronomy discussion group was formed in 2016 under the guidance of Siddhant Singh.\nFunctioning\nThe student body of spAts is divided into two subgroups - the core teams consisting of Design team, Tech team and Management team (which is more concerned with management and outreach) and the FQTQ team (which is more based on Astronomical discussions and applications). spAts organises sky-gazing sessions, space-themed discussions and talks, webinars, lectures, presentations and publishes the bi-semester newsletter, \"the moonwalk\" for the people in the IIT Kharagpur community. The teams also organise the National Students' Space Challenge during the months of September-October.\nSelection Procedure\nspAts organises its selections during late August, once per year that is aimed only for the newly joining freshers for a continued membership till the end of the members' tenure. spAts organises an introductory seminar before the selections, where the functioning of the society as well as about NSSC is presented.\nThe interested candidates join as Junior Coordinators (JCoords) who conduct the NSSC. For the JCoord team, the candidate's technological, management, communication skills etc. are considered.\nLater, selections for joining the spAts team happen, where interested candidates select one portfolio from the FQTQ team, Design team, Tech team and Management team where emphasis is given on prior knowledge in the specific portfolio, presentation skills, previous experience with the concerned technologies and knowledge in the fields of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Selections are done in three rounds, an initial interview, a task round and a final interview where the task submissions are reviewed.\nOrganisational Structure\nspAts is mainly comprised of its two subgroups - the Core teams and the FQTQ team. Each subgroup have their own undertaking tasks but mainly the whole team collectively organises the NSSC fest.\nCore teams\nThese teams are mainly responsible for Management, Outreach, Communication, Publicity, Sponsor handling, Design, Web Design and Finance for the fest and the other activities spAts organises. The core teams consist of the Design team, the Tech team and the Management team\nFQTQ team\nFQTQ stands for From Quarks to Quasars, which describes the team more oriented to astrophysics in general. They hold periodic discussions and presentations on various topics along with sky-gazing events, open talks, webinars and content development.\nNSSC\nConducting the fest remains a major task for the whole spAts team. The team structure is as follows -\n5th and the 4th years comprise the Steering Committee (SCom)\n3rd Years are the Heads\n2nd Years function as Sub-Heads for the various events\nFirst Years contribute as Junior Coordinators (JCoords) for the fest\nList of Activities\nspAts organizes a lot of activities within the campus, as mentioned below.\nInduction Workshop\nThe spAts team interacts with the new coming Freshers batch during the Induction Programme through a series of presentations and workshops. In 2018, presentation on the life cycle of stars, the ever endless universe; and hand-on experience through water rocket lift-off workshop was conducted. The workshop received a positive response from the participants.\nNational Students' Space Challenge\nThe\nNational Students' Space Challenge\n, abbreviated as\nNSSC\n, is an annual space-themed fest organised in the month of September-October since the year 2011. It is India's first and the largest space technology and Astronomy themed fest. The whole spAts team is indulged in organizing the fest.\nFor more details find it on -\nNSSC\nSky-Gazing Sessions\nspAts also works to popularize astronomy among the people in the KGP community. Hence it organizes sky-gazing sessions every semester and also to cover exciting astronomical events, like the super blood red moon 30th January, 2017.\nSpace Month\nEvery Year spAts observes the month of March as Space Month, where a series of open discussions, webinars quiz or presentations are held. This space month primarily aimed to bring and contribute towards recent developments in space technology.\nThe Moonwalk\nThe Moonwalk is a bi-semester newsletter brought by the spAts team. It includes articles written on several astrophysical ideas, new perspectives arising in space and planetary sciences, recent developments in the field, contributions by eminent scientists over the world and discoveries.\nAwards and Achievements\nCompetition\nVenue\nAbout\nYear\nPosition\nAstro Quiz, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi\nTeam name - \"TheKGPCrux\"\n2019\nGOLD\nExploring the Interstellar, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi\nObservational astronomy based event\n2019\nSILVER\nScientists of Utopia, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi\nCase study event\n2019\nSILVER\nScientists of Utopia, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi (Online)\nCase study event\n2021\nGOLD\nAstro Quiz, Supernova, TechNex\nIIT (BHU) Varanasi (Online)\nSpace Quiz Event\n2021\nGOLD\nInternational Astronomy and Astrophysics Competition\nOnline\nEeshaan Sethia (Subhead) - International Runner Up\n2022\nNational Topper\nReferences\n↑\nNSSC\n↑\n\"Reaching for the stars\"\n.

Solution of wave equation.\nStudent Opinion\nWe learn many methods to find approximate solutions to differential equations with shocking accuracy.The material is very practical as can be directly used in many departmental subjects.The methods are very interesting can motivate the students to learn more about them.On other note,The course is tough and hectic and takes so much time to practise.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nThe course is tough compared to other mathematics subjects.The course has very less theory part but needs so much practice. Someone with less calculation speed and who has the habit of making calculation errors is going to suffer. However this can be avoided by practicing regularly.\nThe problems are almost the same every year but still one needs to learn everything.The best way to performance in this is to understand the concepts clearly and practice regularly.\nClassroom resources\nNumerical Solutions to Differential Equations - MK Jain\nAdditional Resources\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=MA20102:_Numerical_Solution_Of_Ordinary_And_Pde&oldid=103653\n\""

        "title": "How to prepare for GATE",
        "content": "This guide was originally written by Tushar Singh Soam (BT '17), Electronics and Communication section was added by Ashish Manmode (EC '17), Mechanical section was added by Vivek Narsaria (ME '17) and Mining Section was added by Vibhas Jaiswal (MI '17)\nThe Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) is an all-\nIndia\nexamination that primarily tests the comprehensive understanding of various undergraduate subjects in engineering and science. The score is used for admissions to various\npost-graduate education\nprograms (e.g. Master of Engineering, Master of Technology, Doctor of Philosophy) in Indian higher education institutes, with financial assistance provided by MHRD and other government agencies.\nBiotechnology\nSyllabus\nThough it is revised a bit at regular intervals but broad outlines remain almost the same. It consists of the following three sections.\nBiotechnology (~72%):\nGeneral Biotechnology\nBiochemistry\nMicrobiology\nMolecular Biology and Genetics\nAnalytical Techniques\nImmunology\nBioinformatics\nRecombinant DNA Technology\nPlants and Animal Biotechnology\nBioprocess Engineering\nGeneral Aptitude (Common for all streams) (~15%):\nVerbal ability\nNumerical ability\nEngineering Mathematics (Stream specific) (~13%):\nA long list. It’s better to check this from host institute’s GATE website.\nPreparation strategy\nIt depends on how serious a student has been throughout the courses that he/she has been taught during the regular coursework. Given the worst case scenario, it will still not take more than 2 months to go through all the required concepts. Considering the syllabus, GATE (Biotechnology) paper can be divided as follows:\nAptitude + Mathematics\nDifficulty level -> Average\nThis is the easiest portion of the exam, need not waste much time on this to prepare but ensure you get it all right in exam. Solve as much question as possible from previous year GATE question papers or sample papers available. Basic level questions from Mathematics – 1 & 2 (1\nst\nyear) will be asked.\nNumerical from Biotechnology\nA good amount of quantitative questions will be asked from Bioprocess engineering, Analytical biotechnology, Enzymes biotechnology and Classical Genetics combined with simple probability concepts. One needs to be thorough with the concepts (which are actually very few) from above topics and a bit of practice leads to a very good score in this section. Good score in this section makes a big difference to the overall score obtained since generally biotechnology students lack mathematics background at intermediate level.\nData Interpretation\nSome questions are set to test the inference skills of students. These questions may or may not require the background knowledge of the domain they belong to but require critical analysis of the situation in the problem. These question can be compared to Logical Reasoning section of other standard aptitude tests.\nFactual Biotechnology\nThere are some questions in paper which test the amount of literature one has consumed. There isn’t any specific strategy for such types of questions, the best advice is just to keep revising the topics under syllabus as much as possible from different sources.\nStudy material\nClass notes, any competitive book for preparation of GATE, Biotechnology. Other standard books are Lehninger for Biochemistry, Prescott for Microbiology, Janeways for Immunology etc.\nElectronics and Communication\nSyllabus\nEvery year the host institute provides the syllabus for GATE, but the general topics that are covered remains the same. For the current year syllabus students are advised to visit the GATE website.\nSubject\n(~85%)\nEngineering Mathematics\nNetworks, Signals and Systems\nElectronic Devices\nAnalog Circuits\nDigital Circuits\nControl Systems\nCommunications\nElectromagnetics\nGeneral Aptitude\n(~15%)\nVerbal Ability\nNumerical Ability\nPreparation Strategy\nIf the student have attended and taken up all the coursework seriously for previous 3 years, then preparing for GATE wont be a tough ballgame. Even if that's not the case dedicated preparation for 2 months will do the task.\nStudy Materials\nFollowing standard textbooks with self-study helps in the overall preparation.\nAlan V. Oppenheim for Signals and Systems,\nBenjamin C. Kuo for Control Systems,\nNetwork analysis by Valkenberg,\nMicroelectronic Circuits by Sedra,Smith,\nDigital Design by Morris Mano.\nMechanical\nSyllabus\nVisit GATE website for current year detailed syllabus.\nStream Specific Topics\n(~85%)\nEngineering Mathematics\n– Linear algebra, calculus, differential equations, complex variables, probability and statistics, numerical methods\nApplied Mechanics and Design\n– Engineering mechanics, mechanics of materials, theory of machines, vibrations, machine design\nFluid Mechanics and Thermal Sciences\n– Fluid mechanics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, advanced thermo-fluids\nMaterials, Manufacturing and Industrial Engineering\n– Engineering materials, casting forming and joining processes, machining and machine tool operations, metrology and inspection, CIM, inventory control, operations research\nGeneral Aptitude Topics\n(~15%)\nVerbal Ability\n- English grammar, sentence completion, verbal analogies, word groups, instructions, critical reasoning, verbal deduction.\nNumerical Ability\n- Numerical computation, numerical estimation, numerical reasoning, data interpretation\nPreparation Strategy\nYou can give preference to the subject in the following order:\nProduction, Industrial\nThermodynamics, Fluid mechanics, HMT/RAC\nStrength of material, Theory of machines, Machine design\nMaterial science, Power plant, IC Engine, Mechanics\nStudy Materials\nFollowing standard textbooks with self-study helps in the overall preparation.\nThermal Sciences - Engineering Thermodynamics by P. K Nag, Thermodyanmics by Cengel\nFluid Mechanics - Introduction to Fluid Mechanics & Fluid Machines by S. K Som\nTheory of Machines - Theory of Machines by S S Rattan\nStrength of Materials - Strength of Materials by Gere & Timoshenko\nManufacturing - Production Technology: Manufacturing Processes, Technology and Automation by R.K.

It'll become easy for you to prepare.\nIf you haven't, then identify your weak areas i.e. your weak topics.\nTake a note of the pattern by going the previous year papers. Last 5 years question papers would be quite sufficient but if you get hold of last 10 years, it would be great.\nThis will help you in identifying the important topics and your strong and weak zones.\nNow focus on eliminating your weak zones.\nSolve as many questions as you can to excel in your exams.\nDon't have an attitude of \"just passing\" the exam\n.\nTry giving mock tests and\ndo analyse them\ncarefully.\nStudy Materials\nLecture notes of your professors.\nA Complete Guide for Mining Engineers by Dr. A.K. Gorai\n(I will recommend this book for the last minute study and NOT for preparation of the exams)\nGATE Mining Engineering by B.N. Bhagat & Sachin Lal\n(I DO NOT recommend this book as most of the solutions in this book are wrong. But you can go through the questions given. They are good.)\nCalculation of GATE score\nGATE 2025\n[\n1\n]\nscore will be calculated using the formula:\nGATE Score =\nS\nq\n+ (\nS\nt\n- S\nq\n)(\nM - M\nq\n)/(\nM\nt\n- M\nq\n)\nIn the above formula;\nM\n= marks obtained by the candidate (actual marks for single session papers and normalized marks for multi-session papers)\nM\nq\n= is the qualifying marks for general category candidate in the paper\nM\nt\n= is the mean of marks of top 0.1% or top 10 (whichever is larger) of the candidates who appeared in the paper (in case of multi-session papers including all sessions)\nS\nq\n= 350, is the score assigned to\nM\nq\nS\nt\n= 900, is the score assigned to\nM\nt\nQualifying Marks\nThe rules for qualifying marks have varied from year to year. The qualifying marks (out of 100) are different for different subjects as well as categories.\nCategory\nQualifying Marks (out of 100) for 2025\n[\n1\n]\nGeneral\nmax(25 or min(40, µ+σ))\nOBC\n90% of general category's qualifying mark.\nSC and ST\n2/3 (i.e., 66.67%) of general category's qualifying mark.\nHere μ is the average (i.e., arithmetic mean) of marks of all candidates in the subject (with negative marks converted to zero) and σ is the standard deviation of all marks in that subject.\nUsually, the general category’s qualifying mark is in the 25 to 50 range.\nSummary\nThough it seems that GATE syllabus is quite heavy, but analyzing the previous year question paper one can easily figure out that it only asks question related to the very essence of subjects covered in syllabus and focuses more on general aptitude of the student. So to everybody who is going to sit for GATE, All the Best!\nExternal Links\nGATE CS guide on GeeksForGeeks\n↑\n1.0\n1.1\nGATE2025_InformationBrochure.pdf\n, page 29\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_prepare_for_GATE&oldid=239694\n\""
