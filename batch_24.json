Harry, who was unwell at that time, took some time to open the door. This infuriated the seniors and they wanted to drag Harry to the sports trials, despite the fact that he was unwell.\nMeanwhile, another third-year student named Tommy came rushing, repeatedly shouting at Harry at the top of his voice. In irritation, Harry uttered an abusive word. In retaliation, Tommy tightly slapped him twice. Then, he choked Harry against the wall and slapped him a few more times. This left scratches and bruises on the victim.\nThe investigation into this case is still in progress. There is a common perception that this is a fairly simple case of ragging with several witnesses and enough proof backing this version of events.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Incident_of_Ragging_in_IIT_Kharagpur&oldid=97597\n\""

You need to have taken the 2 courses or convince the Professor that you already know these topics. Quantum Mechanics is a bit hard topic. So in the short time, it might be difficult to grasp the ideas of Quantum Mechanics, if you studying it for the first time in this course. A bit of self-study is needed to understand Quantum Mechanics part of this course, if the pace of the course is fast.\nThe second half of the course Quantum Computing, requires minimum basics discussed in the first half of the course. Linear Algebra basics come into use here. Just following the classes will be helpful to understand the topics.\nClassroom resources\nQuantum Mechanics:\nAssignment 1 - 2021\nAssignment 1 - 2021 Solutions - UNVERIFED\nAssignment 2 - 2021\nQuiz 2020\nQuantum Computing:\nQuantum Computation and Quantum Information by Nielsen and Chuang\n: First 2 chapters are good enough for the course\nQuantum Computing for Computer Scientist\n: Algorithms are well explained in this book\nAssignment 2021\nAssignment 2021 Solutions - UNVERIFED\nPrevious Year Assignments 2019\nExam with Solutions 2021\nAdditional Resources\nLinear Algebra\n3blue1brown Playlist\nMIT OCW Lectures by Prof. Gilbert Strang\nQuantum Mechanics\nLectures by Professor Susskind\n- One of the Best introductory Lectures\nMIT OCW Lectures  Quantum Physics I - Prof. Allan Adams and Prof. Barton\n- If you want to get a deeper understanding of QM and have time\nQuantum Computing\nQuantum Computation and Quantum Information by Nielsen and Chuang\nQuantum Computing for Computer Scientist\nQiskit Textbook\n: A good place to read and implement - both basics and algorithms\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=TS70006:_Quantum_Mechanics_and_Quantum_Computing&oldid=146293\n\""

Code data structures taught at least two times, if possible, try to solve previous year's assignments.\nWhile doing the assignment, if a part of your code doesn't work, then comment it out and submit it with the part of your code that works. TAs read the code you wrote and give you some marks accordingly. In case a part of your code fails for just one/two test cases only, submit it as it is, you may still score good marks on it, the output holds a certain weightage and you will be given marks only if it is correct, otherwise zero for that test case.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nClassroom resources\nAdditional Resources\nTime Table\nDay\n8:00-8:55 am\n9:00-9:55 am\n10:00-10:55 am\n11:00-11:55 am\n12:00-12:55 pm\n2:00-2:55 pm\n3:00-3:55 pm\n4:00-4:55 pm\n5:00-5:55 pm\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nIn Dept\nIn Dept\nIn Dept\nFriday\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=CS29003:_Algorithms_Laboratory&oldid=86847\n\""

It provides a platform for like-minded individuals who yearn to enrich their knowledge of business and apply their skills in various competitions like case studies and hackathons at the national and international levels. A family of around 70 student members, actively working under 3 wings:\nStrategy, Finance, and Analytics\n, BClub is constantly striving to bridge the gap between business and technology.\nHistory\nFounding\nBusiness Club was founded in 2009 as\nGenese-de-Strategie\nby Shailesh Gupta, Harsh Gupta, Srichandana Sanjeev, Sudipto Sannigrahi, and Mayank Mundra. Genesie-de-Strategie was started with a primary objective to educate the students about the world of business strategies. The founders felt a need for students to be informed about the working of the business world for their growth. Over the course of a year, they realised the need to have a more wholesome approach to the world of business. They formed the Business Club in 2010 with a broader perspective toward business.\nGrowth\nIndian Case Challenge,\nIndia’s largest case competition, is the flagship event of the Business Club. ICC now witnesses international participation as well.\nAffiliation to Technology Students’ Gymkhana\n(during the academic session 2014-15) brought official recognition to the club.\nThe Business Club has started to reach out to the entire student population of the college by conducting\nOpen House Sessions\nfor their benefit.\nRegular\nsocial media content\nand\nblogs\nin the domain of finance, strategy and analytics are uploaded on all major social media platforms to keep readers updated.\nFunctioning\nSelections\nSelections to the Business Club are held at the beginning of the first and the second academic year.\nFirst-year selections\nThe selection procedure consists of a\ngroup-discussion\nround followed by a personal\ninterview\nfor the shortlisted candidates. Prospective members aren’t judged based on their business acumen, but on their ability to think clearly, present thoughts in a concise and structured manner, their dedication, and their zeal to learn.\nSecond-year selections\nA training period called the\nsummer program\nis conducted for the students selected in the second academic year to level their knowledge with the students selected in the first year. During this time, they are provided with the same resources to learn everything necessary.\nAfter the summer program, every associate is evaluated on the same knowledge level and a final personal interview is conducted to select the students with the highest knowledge in the three domains. Other soft skills like communication are also kept in mind. Selected students are then assigned the position of sub-heads.\nStructure\nBusiness Club has a four-level organisational structure.\nAdvisors\nconsist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the club.\nThe executive body comprises of\nGovernors\nand\nHeads\nwho are in the third year of their study. They are responsible for heading various wings of the club and its management.\nThe team of\nSub-heads\nis responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the club and the execution of its plans. It consists of students in the second year of their studies.\nAssociates\nare the first years who have a passion to win and are generally business-oriented. These members are oriented towards gaining as much knowledge as they can from the pool of knowledge available to the seniors.\nThe functional structure of the Business Club consists of three wings –\nfinance, analytics, and strategy\n. These wings include all that happens within the world of business.\nActivities\nIntra-Club activities\nTo prepare the associates for the sub-head tenure, they are encouraged to participate in various activities to lay a strong foundation in the three domains of Analytics, Finance, and Strategy. These activities include:\nIntra-club case study Competition\n- The associate batch is divided into small groups and each team is allotted a sub-head as a mentor, who guides the associate batch in solving the problem statement. On the D-day, the executive batch judges the teams through their presentations, and valuable inputs are given.\nKnowledge meets\n- Organising knowledge meetings is the way by which knowledge dissipation happens in the Club. These meetings are conducted by Club members, where they meet and brainstorm on various topics of interest. A strong network consisting of resourceful seniors and mentor professors clarifies any doubts the members may have and make the meetings fruitful.\nWhitepaper -\nThis event is organized so that the associates could choose and research the topic of their choice in the domain of the three wings of the B-club. During the event, Associates put around 20 days of research and at the end present their papers in front of the executive and sub-head Batch, where they give useful insights into the topic\nDrafting modules and blogs -\nClub members design modules and blogs in the three wings. These modules are released through the public handle.\nSummer program\nDuring the Summer holidays, many first-years apart from the Associate Batch are selected for the program as Summer Associates.\nCase study competition\n- This is the second intra-club case study competition. This time associates are made to solve the problem statement on their own without the mentorship of seniors, considering they have already done the courses in the three domains.\nAnalytics competition\n- This competition concentrates on the core of machine learning. Associates are given a data set and this competition demands writing algorithms without using built-in libraries and maximizing the accuracy score on the given dataset.\nTrading Competition -\nDuring this competition Associates and Summer Associates create a mock trading account. This competition lasts for 10 days and associates carry out intraday trading based on the technical and fundamental analysis they have learned in the program.\nAt the end of the summer program, based on the performance and participation in the summer program, associates are selected to be the part of sub-head batch.\nEvents organized by the Club\nThe club conducts a wide range of activities such as open house sessions and case studies enabling students to develop their business acumen by applying their skills and finding solutions to real-world problem statements.\nIndian Case Challenge\nEver since its inception in 2012, the Indian Case Challenge provides the best platform for undergraduate and graduate students from all over India to compete against each other and prove their business and entrepreneurial mettle in a real-life business case scenario. Not only are the participants expected to have strong business skills and financial understanding, but also a feeling for entrepreneurship and a sense of realizing market opportunities.\nICC 2021, organized in association with Kshitij, was a huge success and received a whopping 3200+ unique registrations, including international participation.\nOpen House Sessions\nBusiness Club strives to impart basic knowledge regarding the various facets of business, in an attempt to make the students of IIT Kharagpur more equipped to thrive in the ever-evolving global industry. Open house sessions on basic finance, analytics, and strategy that are conducted in conjunction with organizations such as Alphabeta, ZS Associates, and IIMC Consulting Club have gone a long way towards this.\nWebinars\nInformative webinars, presided by renowned speakers who excel in their respective business fields, are conducted by the club, to enrich the knowledge of the students even in online mode.\nGovernors and Heads\n2014-15\nGovernors\nSarthak Badjatiya\nShramajit Gupta\nVirendra Singh\nHeads\nAnalytics: Pranay Yadav\nConsultancy: Pratyush Devliyal\nFinance: Umang Mavani\nTechnical: Ravikiran Shinde\n2015-16\nGovernors\nAshutosh Dwivedi\nNishant Jayaswal\nShiladitya Saha\nHeads\nAnalytics: Raunak Chitlangia, Shubhrit Agrawal\nConsultancy: Manik Aggarwal\nFinance: Dhruva Ratanpura\nTechnical: Murtaza Phalasiya, Rajat Bhavnani\nLogistics: Rihen Chheda, Ritwik Bajaj\n2016-17\nGovernors\nPriya Mehta\nKumar Sparsh\nUdit Sarin\nHeads\nAnalytics: Charu Agarwal, Shwetha Krishnamurthy\nFinance: Debjyoti Chakrabarti\nConsultancy: Medha Asija\nTechnical: Shubham Singhal, Vaibhav Chauhan\n2017-18\nGovernors\nHarsh Agarwal\nHitendra Pratap\nShubhra Agrawal\nHeads\nAnalytics: Ankit Agarwal, Subham Rajgaria\nFinance: Ankit Agarwal, Rajat Ragha, Shubham Sharma\nStrategy: Shubham Maheshwari\nBlogs and Articles: Rahul Raj\nDesign: Anjali Bharti\n2018-19\nGovernors\nAman Sharma\nNikita Kishore\nHeads\nAnalytics: Yash Jain\nFinance: Amandeep Singh, Puneet Pansari\nStrategy: Amit Gunjan, Yogshree Choukse\n2019-20\nGovernors\nAditya Parashar\nDeepankar Sachdeva\nHeads\nAnalytics: Amrit Goswami, Chinmay Singh, Karan Mahajan\nFinance: Shreyansh Jain, Vikrant Gupta\nStrategy: Tushar Mohandas, Tushar Singla\nTechnical: Aditya Singhania\n2020-21\nGovernors\nAryan Saxena\nLakshraj Doshi\nShashank Singh\nHeads\nAnalytics: Arusarka Bose, Naman Paharia, Abhinav Bohra\nFinance: Sayantan Das, Lakshiyata Chhajer, Amur Khandelwal\nStrategy: Shivam, Gaurav Joshi, Inakshi Kar\n2021-22\nGovernors\nArya Uttamchandani\nSankalp Bose\nHeads\nAnalytics: Karan Uppal, Dikshant Pratap Singh\nFinance: Arnav Bhutda, Suhas Jain, Aditya Saha\nStrategy: Tejaswi Pagadala, Kashish Lundia\nWeb: Piyush Dhamane\nBranding and Public Relations: Deepansh Agrawal\n2022-2023\nGovernors\nMadiha Hanifa\nBharat Uday\nHeads\nAnalytics: Vaibhav Jalani\nStrategy: Siddharth Madupathi, Pragya Choudhary\nFinance: Ram Sundaram, Patel Yuti\nWeb and Design: Sai Kalyan Meghavath\n2023-2024\nGovernors\nSiddharth Dikshit\nShreeya Mishra\nHeads\nAnalytics: Adyan Rizvi, Ishan Ray, Lokesh Tirthani\nFinance: Suryaansh Jindal, Ojasvi R Singh\nStrategy: Atmajyoti Ghosh, Arya Vardhan Singh, Jash Mody\n2024-2025\nGovernors\nArnav Bansal\nAnshul Trehan\nHeads\nAnalytics: Arya Dighde\nFinance: Aman Samriya, Manya S.

KLUG meetings are traditionally held on Fridays at\nInsti Foyer\nor\nBC Roy Hall\n's canteen.\nHistory\nThe earliest known Linux Users Group at KGP was started back in 2004,\n[\n1\n]\nthough a thread on their Yahoo group suggests that there used be a LUG even before 2004.\n[\n2\n]\nThey held few informal meetings and a install fest.\n[\n3\n]\nThe group, however, died out by the end of academic year in 2007.\n[\n4\n]\nRamkumar Ramachandra mentioned about another Linux Users group which used to exist between 2006 and 2008.\n[\n5\n]\nKGP: KGP Group of Programmers (a recursive acronym) which came up in 2009\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nwas also an attempt to build a programmer's community in KGP that group too died out. The current form of KLUG was formed by Ramkumar Ramachandra (PH '12), Sanjoy Das (MA '13) and Anurag Priyam (ME '13) in 2011.\nStructure and Functioning\nThe discussion at KLUG typically do not have a fixed agenda. People start off by discussing different projects they have been working on but often conversations diverge to very diverse topics including anything from history, privacy and copyright laws, economics to philosophy. KLUG follows a flat hierarchy and an system of open membership. Open membership implies that anyone is free and welcomed to attend the discussion. New members are usually asked to introduce themselves to the group.\nImportant minutes of the meetings or meetup notices are posted to the\nKLUG's google group\n, which is open for anyone are join. KLUG has recently moved to slack channel for real time communication and hangout in place of IRC channel #klug-devel on freenode. A public log of all the communication on previous channel can be found\nhere\n.\nPeople interested in joining KLUG's slack channel use the self invite link\nhttp://klug-slack.herokuapp.com/.\nReferences\n↑\n\"Announcement of LUG@IITKGP\"\n.

        "content": "Eastern Technology Music Society\n, popularly known as\nETMS\n, is one of the two official music societies in IIT Kharagpur, which takes care of the eastern music culture in the campus. The society aims at spreading diverse musical sections of eastern music in both hindustani and carnatic styles, nurturing and motivating musicians, inculcating values and expression through music, and develop good music taste among our audience.\nFunctioning\nSelection Procedure\nETMS selection auditions are held twice in a year, in the autumn semester for all students (UG/PG), around the month of July/August and January. Selection procedure generally consist of two rounds, where the first round is a preliminary screening round to assess basic musical ability, comfort with the instrument (or singing), basic knowledge, and screened candidates are invited to give a second round of auditions where they are given few (2-3) songs to prepare. For instrumentalists, the songs that are decided are generally same for everyone, and they are chosen such that they cover a diverse spectrum of techniques/skills in the particular instrument, and for vocalists, the songs are given on the basis of the pitch range and the singer's tonality. There is generally a gap of 3-4 days between both rounds of the auditions.\nOrganizational Structure\nETMS has three governors selected by the society seniors every year who govern the society and represent it in Gymkhana. Overall co-ordination during practices, productions and competitions are handled by the governors.\nActivities\nThe primary activities of the society include organizing and performing two productions every academic year, one in the Autumn Semester and the other in Spring Semester. The playlist is decided few weeks prior to the production through a consensus of all the members in the society. Songs are chosen so that the playlist is as diverse as possible, consisting of genres such as Classical, Classical Fusion, Fusion with western genres and songs from Bollywood.\nAutumn Production\nETMS performs the Annual Foundation Day of the Institute in the autumn semester on 18th August. This is also the first time the new inductees get the chance to perform for the society.\nSpring Production\nETMS performs the spring production in the spring semester generally in the month of January, the starting day of Spring Fest. This production also gives the platform to showcase our talent to viewers from outside as well. This happens to be the final production of the graduating batch and they get a chance to play some of their favourite songs for one last time in KGP.\nGovernors\nList of Governors\n2019-20\nParitosh Jawalikar\nRaj Narayanan\n-\n2018-19\nManan Makhija\nMohit Verma\nNishok Sundarresan\n2017-18\nAshandeep Singh Sekhon\nMohnish Singh Jaswal\nSreekar Saripalli\n2016-17\nAbhishek Bhowmick\nVinay Bhaskar\nYash Deo\n2015-16\nGaurav Kumar Jha\nNayan Mallick\nSanat Panda\n2014-15\nChandrani Haldar\nRohit Narurkar\nSatyajit Sai\n2013-14\nApoorv Raj\nSiddharth Vashishtha\nSricharan Sunder\n2012-13\nAnurag Bishnoi\nGaurav Gupta\nKaushik Sivaramakrishnan\n2011-12\nAnkit D.P.\nHari Cherupalli\nJuhi Agrawal\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=Eastern_Technology_Music_Society&oldid=146301\n\""

Lubrication of joints. Motion and gait analysis – method, gait cycle, segmental kinetics, engineering approaches to posture analysis. Joint replacement and fracture fixation – stress analysis and basic design approach, failure mechanisms, wear in joint arthroplasty, bone remodelling, biomaterials – properties and application.\nConcepts taught in class\nMechanics of Human Body is a subject that applies the concepts mechanical engineering to the human body. We start with the presumption that the human body is a machine with links, joints and actuators. The course topics till mid-semester include:\nTypes of joints\nSynovial\nCartilaginous\nFibrous\nMuscles and Tendons\nJoints:\nKnee\nShoulder\nElbow\nHip\nThere is also elaborate discussion on prosthetics, sports biomechanics.\nStudent Opinion\nThis is an extremely interesting subject, the lectures are short, non-boring, and icky(when he tells you about the different ways to tear ligaments). Also, you'll get to play with fibre replicas of different joints and bones.\nFun trivia:\nThere're ligaments in the knee called anterior and posterior cruciate(like \"cruciatus\") ligaments, which have a role in the osteoarthritis pain\nMost of the joints in our body are unstable, such as the shoulder/glenohumeral joint, and can displace with little disruption.\nHow to Crack the Paper\nPractice previous years' questions papers, over 80% is repeated verbatim.\nFor shoulder/knee/elbow/hip, remember the following\nmuscles, ligaments,tendons and bones\nnames and types of all joints\ndegrees of freedom\nClassroom resources\nAll classroom resources are updated on Google Drive and shared by the professor.\nSuggested reference books\nNordin & Frankel\nAdditional Resources\n↑\n1.0\n1.1\nVerified\nby\nAngry Bitch\non 2016-02-16.\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=EX41004:_Nuclear_Geophysics&oldid=16322\n\""
